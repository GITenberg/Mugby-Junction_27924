1</span>BARBOX BROTHERS</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Guard!&nbsp; What place is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mugby Junction, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A windy place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it mostly is, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And looks comfortless indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it generally does, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a rainy night still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pours, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have, sir,&rdquo; said the guard,
glistening with drops of wet, and looking at the tearful face of
his watch by the light of his lantern as the traveller descended,
&ldquo;three minutes here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More, I think.&mdash;For I am not going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you had a through ticket, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>&ldquo;So I have, but I shall sacrifice the rest of
it.&nbsp; I want my luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please to come to the van and point it out, sir.&nbsp;
Be good enough to look very sharp, sir.&nbsp; Not a moment to
spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard hurried to the luggage van, and the traveller
hurried after him.&nbsp; The guard got into it, and the traveller
looked into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two large black portmanteaus in the corner where
your light shines.&nbsp; Those are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name upon &rsquo;em, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barbox Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand clear, sir, if you please.&nbsp; One.&nbsp;
Two.&nbsp; Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamp waved.&nbsp; Signal lights ahead already changing.&nbsp;
Shriek from engine.&nbsp; Train gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mugby Junction!&rdquo; said the traveller, pulling up
the woollen muffler round his throat with both hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At past three o&rsquo;clock of a tempestuous
morning!&nbsp; So!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke to himself.&nbsp; There was no one else to speak
to.&nbsp; Perhaps, though there had been any one else to speak
to, he would have preferred to speak to himself.&nbsp; Speaking
to himself, he spoke to a man within five years of fifty either
way, who had turned grey too soon, like a neglected fire; a man
of pondering habit, brooding carriage of the head, and suppressed
internal voice; a man with many indications on him of having been
much alone.</p>
<p><!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>He stood unnoticed on the dreary platform, except by the
rain and by the wind.&nbsp; Those two vigilant assailants made a
rush at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he,
yielding.&nbsp; &ldquo;It signifies nothing to me, to what
quarter I turn my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, at Mugby Junction, at past three o&rsquo;clock of a
tempestuous morning, the traveller went where the weather drove
him.</p>
<p>Not but what he could make a stand when he was so minded, for,
coming to the end of the roofed shelter (it is of considerable
extent at Mugby Junction) and looking out upon the dark night,
with a yet darker spirit-wing of storm beating its wild way
through it, he faced about, and held his own as ruggedly in the
difficult direction, as he had held it in the easier one.&nbsp;
Thus, with a steady step, the traveller went up and down, up and
down, up and down, seeking nothing, and finding it.</p>
<p>A place replete with shadowy shapes, this Mugby Junction in
the black hours of the four-and-twenty.&nbsp; Mysterious goods
trains, covered with palls and gliding on like vast weird
funerals, conveying themselves guiltily away from the presence of
the few lighted lamps, as if their freight had come to a secret
and unlawful end.&nbsp; Half miles of coal pursuing in a
Detective manner, following when they lead, stopping when they
stop, backing when they back.&nbsp; Red hot embers showering out
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>upon the ground, down this dark avenue, and down the
other, as if torturing fires were being raked clear;
concurrently, shrieks and groans and grinds invading the ear, as
if the tortured were at the height of their suffering.&nbsp;
Iron-barred cages full of cattle jangling by midway, the drooping
beasts with horns entangled, eyes frozen with terror, and mouths
too: at least they have long icicles (or what seem so) hanging
from their lips.&nbsp; Unknown languages in the air, conspiring
in red, green, and white characters.&nbsp; An earthquake
accompanied with thunder and lightning, going up express to
London.</p>
<p>Now, all quiet, all rusty, wind and rain in possession, lamps
extinguished, Mugby Junction dead and indistinct, with its robe
drawn over its head, like C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; Now, too, as the
belated traveller plodded up and down, a shadowy train went by
him in the gloom which was no other than the train of a
life.&nbsp; From whatsoever intangible deep cutting or dark
tunnel it emerged, here it came, unsummoned and unannounced,
stealing upon him and passing away into obscurity.&nbsp; Here,
mournfully went by, a child who had never had a childhood or
known a parent, inseparable from a youth with a bitter sense of
his namelessness, coupled to a man the enforced business of whose
best years had been distasteful and oppressive, linked to an
ungrateful friend, dragging after him a woman once <!-- page
5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>beloved.&nbsp; Attendant, with many a clank and wrench,
were lumbering cares, dark meditations, huge dim disappointments,
monotonous years, a long jarring line of the discords of a
solitary and unhappy existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Yours, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traveller recalled his eyes from the waste into which they
had been staring, and fell back a step or so under the
abruptness, and perhaps the chance appropriateness, of the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; My thoughts were not here for the
moment.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Those two portmanteaus are
mine.&nbsp; Are you a Porter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Porter&rsquo;s wages, sir.&nbsp; But I am
Lamps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traveller looked a little confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you say you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamps, sir,&rdquo; showing an oily cloth in his hand,
as further explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, surely.&nbsp; Is there any hotel or tavern
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly here, sir.&nbsp; There is a Refreshment
Room here, but&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Lamps, with a mighty serious
look, gave his head a warning roll that plainly
added&mdash;&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a blessed circumstance for you
that it&rsquo;s not open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t recommend it, I see, if it was
available?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask your pardon, sir.&nbsp; If it
was&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my place, as a paid servant of the <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>company to give my opinion on any of the company&rsquo;s
toepics,&rdquo; he pronounced it more like toothpicks,
&ldquo;beyond lamp-ile and cottons,&rdquo; returned Lamps, in a
confidential tone; &ldquo;but speaking as a man, I wouldn&rsquo;t
recommend my father (if he was to come to life again) to go and
try how he&rsquo;d be treated at the Refreshment Room.&nbsp; Not
speaking as a man, no, I would <i>not</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The traveller nodded conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose I can
put up in the town?&nbsp; There is a town here?&rdquo;&nbsp; For
the traveller (though a stay-at-home compared with most
travellers) had been, like many others, carried on the steam
winds and the iron tides through that Junction before, without
having ever, as one might say, gone ashore there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, there&rsquo;s a town, sir.&nbsp; Anyways
there&rsquo;s town enough to put up in.&nbsp; But,&rdquo;
following the glance of the other at his luggage, &ldquo;this is
a very dead time of the night with us, sir.&nbsp; The deadest
time.&nbsp; I might a&rsquo;most call it our deadest and
buriedest time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No porters about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you see,&rdquo; returned Lamps, confidential
again, &ldquo;they in general goes off with the gas.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s how it is.&nbsp; And they seem to have overlooked
you, through your walking to the furder end of the
platform.&nbsp; But in about twelve minutes or so, she may be
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who may be up?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;The three forty-two, sir.&nbsp; She goes off in a
sidin&rsquo; till the Up X passes, and then she,&rdquo; here an
air of hopeful vagueness pervaded Lamps, &ldquo;doos all as lays
in her power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if I comprehend the arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if anybody do, sir.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a
Parliamentary, sir.&nbsp; And, you see, a Parliamentary, or a
Skirmishun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean an Excursion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, sir.&mdash;A Parliamentary, or a
Skirmishun, she mostly <i>doos</i> go off into a
sidin&rsquo;.&nbsp; But when she <i>can</i> get a chance,
she&rsquo;s whistled out of it, and she&rsquo;s whistled up into
doin&rsquo; all as,&rdquo; Lamps again wore the air of a highly
sanguine man who hoped for the best, &ldquo;all as lays in her
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then explained that porters on duty being required to be in
attendance on the Parliamentary matron in question, would
doubtless turn up with the gas.&nbsp; In the meantime, if the
gentleman would not very much object to the smell of lamp-oil,
and would accept the warmth of his little room.&mdash;The
gentleman being by this time very cold, instantly closed with the
proposal.</p>
<p>A greasy little cabin it was, suggestive to the sense of
smell, of a cabin in a Whaler.&nbsp; But there was a bright fire
burning in its rusty grate, and on the floor there stood a wooden
stand of newly trimmed and lighted lamps, ready for carriage
service.&nbsp; They made a bright <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>show, and their
light, and the warmth, accounted for the popularity of the room,
as borne witness to by many impressions of velveteen trousers on
a form by the fire, and many rounded smears and smudges of
stooping velveteen shoulders on the adjacent wall.&nbsp; Various
untidy shelves accommodated a quantity of lamps and oil-cans, and
also a fragrant collection of what looked like the
pocket-handkerchiefs of the whole lamp family.</p>
<p>As Barbox Brothers (so to call the traveller on the warranty
of his luggage) took his seat upon the form, and warmed his now
ungloved hands at the fire, he glanced aside at a little deal
desk, much blotched with ink, which his elbow touched.&nbsp; Upon
it, were some scraps of coarse paper, and a superannuated steel
pen in very reduced and gritty circumstances.</p>
<p>From glancing at the scraps of paper, he turned involuntarily
to his host, and said, with some roughness&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are never a poet, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamps had certainly not the conventional appearance of one, as
he stood modestly rubbing his squab nose with a handkerchief so
exceedingly oily, that he might have been in the act of mistaking
himself for one of his charges.&nbsp; He was a spare man of about
the Barbox Brothers&rsquo; time of life, with his features
whimsically drawn upward as if they were attracted by the roots
of his hair.&nbsp; He had a <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>peculiarly
shining transparent complexion, probably occasioned by constant
oleaginous application; and his attractive hair, being cut short,
and being grizzled, and standing straight up on end as if it in
its turn were attracted by some invisible magnet above it, the
top of his head was not very unlike a lamp-wick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to be sure it&rsquo;s no business of mine,&rdquo;
said Barbox Brothers.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was an impertinent
observation on my part.&nbsp; Be what you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people, sir,&rdquo; remarked Lamps, in a tone of
apology, &ldquo;are sometimes what they don&rsquo;t
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows that better than I do,&rdquo; sighed the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been what I don&rsquo;t like, all my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first took, sir,&rdquo; resumed Lamps, &ldquo;to
composing little Comic-Songs-like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbox Brothers eyed him with great disfavour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;To composing little Comic-Songs-like&mdash;and
what was more hard&mdash;to singing &rsquo;em afterwards,&rdquo;
said Lamps, &ldquo;it went against the grain at that time, it did
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something that was not all oil here shining in Lamps&rsquo;s
eye, Barbox Brothers withdrew his own a little disconcerted,
looked at the fire, and put a foot on the top bar.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why did you do it, then?&rdquo; he asked, after a short
pause; abruptly enough but in a softer tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;If <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>you didn&rsquo;t want to do it, why did you do it?&nbsp;
Where did you sing them?&nbsp; Public-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Mr. Lamps returned the curious reply:
&ldquo;Bedside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, while the traveller looked at him for
elucidation, Mugby Junction started suddenly, trembled violently,
and opened its gas eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got up!&rdquo;
Lamps announced, excited.&nbsp; &ldquo;What lays in her power is
sometimes more, and sometimes less; but it&rsquo;s laid in her
power to get up to-night, by George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legend &ldquo;Barbox Brothers&rdquo; in large white
letters on two black surfaces, was very soon afterwards trundling
on a truck through a silent street, and, when the owner of the
legend had shivered on the pavement half an hour, what time the
porter&rsquo;s knocks at the Inn Door knocked up the whole town
first, and the Inn last, he groped his way into the close air of
a shut-up house, and so groped between the sheets of a shut-up
bed that seemed to have been expressly refrigerated for him when
last made.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You remember me, Young Jackson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I remember if not you?&nbsp; You are my first
remembrance.&nbsp; It was you who told me that was my name.&nbsp;
It was you who told me that on every twentieth of December <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>my life had a penitential anniversary in it called a
birthday.&nbsp; I suppose the last communication was truer than
the first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I like, Young Jackson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are like a blight all through the year, to
me.&nbsp; You hard-lined, thin-lipped, repressive, changeless
woman with a wax mask on.&nbsp; You are like the Devil to me;
most of all when you teach me religious things, for you make me
abhor them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember me, Mr. Young Jackson?&rdquo;&nbsp; In
another voice from another quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most gratefully, sir.&nbsp; You were the ray of hope
and prospering ambition in my life.&nbsp; When I attended your
course, I believed that I should come to be a great healer, and I
felt almost happy&mdash;even though I was still the one boarder
in the house with that horrible mask, and ate and drank in
silence and constraint with the mask before me, every day.&nbsp;
As I had done every, every, every day, through my school-time and
from my earliest recollection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I like, Mr. Young Jackson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are like a Superior Being to me.&nbsp; You are like
Nature beginning to reveal herself to me.&nbsp; I hear you again,
as one of the hushed crowd of young men kindling under the power
of your presence and knowledge, and you bring into my eyes the
only exultant tears that ever stood in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;You remember Me, Mr. Young Jackson?&rdquo;&nbsp;
In a grating voice from quite another quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too well.&nbsp; You made your ghostly appearance in my
life one day, and announced that its course was to be suddenly
and wholly changed.&nbsp; You showed me which was my wearisome
seat in the Galley of Barbox Brothers.&nbsp; (When <i>they</i>
were, if they ever were, is unknown to me; there was nothing of
them but the name when I bent to the oar.)&nbsp; You told me what
I was to do, and what to be paid; you told me afterwards, at
intervals of years, when I was to sign for the Firm, when I
became a partner, when I became the Firm.&nbsp; I know no more of
it, or of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I like, Mr. Young Jackson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are like my father, I sometimes think.&nbsp; You
are hard enough and cold enough so to have brought up an
unacknowledged son.&nbsp; I see your scanty figure, your close
brown suit, and your tight brown wig; but you, too, wear a wax
mask to your death.&nbsp; You never by a chance remove
it&mdash;it never by a chance falls off&mdash;and I know no more
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout this dialogue, the traveller spoke to himself at
his window in the morning, as he had spoken to himself at the
Junction over-night.&nbsp; And as he had then looked in the
darkness, a man who had turned grey too soon, like a neglected
fire: so he <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>now looked in the sunlight, an ashier
grey, like a fire which the brightness of the sun put out.</p>
<p>The firm of Barbox Brothers had been some offshoot or
irregular branch of the Public Notary and bill-broking
tree.&nbsp; It had gained for itself a griping reputation before
the days of Young Jackson, and the reputation had stuck to it and
to him.&nbsp; As he had imperceptibly come into possession of the
dim den up in the corner of a court off Lombard-street, on whose
grimy windows the inscription Barbox Brothers had for many long
years daily interposed itself between him and the sky, so he had
insensibly found himself a personage held in chronic distrust,
whom it was essential to screw tight to every transaction in
which he engaged, whose word was never to be taken without his
attested bond, whom all dealers with openly set up guards and
wards against.&nbsp; This character had come upon him through no
act of his own.&nbsp; It was as if the original Barbox had
stretched himself down upon the office-floor, and had thither
caused to be conveyed Young Jackson in his sleep, and had there
effected a metempsychosis and exchange of persons with him.&nbsp;
The discovery&mdash;aided in its turn by the deceit of the only
woman he had ever loved, and the deceit of the only friend he had
ever made: who eloped from him to be married together&mdash;the
discovery, so <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>followed up, completed what his
earliest rearing had begun.&nbsp; He shrank, abashed, within the
form of Barbox, and lifted up his head and heart no more.</p>
<p>But he did at last effect one great release in his
condition.&nbsp; He broke the oar he had plied so long, and he
scuttled and sank the galley.&nbsp; He prevented the gradual
retirement of an old conventional business from him, by taking
the initiative and retiring from it.&nbsp; With enough to live on
(though after all with not too much), he obliterated the firm of
Barbox Brothers from the pages of the Post-office Directory and
the face of the earth, leaving nothing of it but its name on two
portmanteaus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one must have some name in going about, for people
to pick up,&rdquo; he explained to Mugby High-street, through the
Inn-window, &ldquo;and that name at least was real once.&nbsp;
Whereas, Young Jackson!&mdash;Not to mention its being a sadly
satirical misnomer for Old Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up his hat and walked out, just in time to see,
passing along on the opposite side of the way, a velveteen man,
carrying his day&rsquo;s dinner in a small bundle that might have
been larger without suspicion of gluttony, and pelting away
towards the Junction at a great pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Lamps!&rdquo; said Barbox Brother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And by-the-by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Ridiculous, surely, that a man so serious, so
self-contained, and not yet three days emancipated from a routine
of drudgery, should stand rubbing his chin in the street, in a
brown study about Comic Songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bedside?&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, testily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sings them at the bedside?&nbsp; Why at the bedside,
unless he goes to bed drunk?&nbsp; Does, I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s no business of mine.&nbsp; Let me
see.&nbsp; Mugby Junction, Mugby Junction.&nbsp; Where shall I go
next?&nbsp; As it came into my head last night when I woke from
an uneasy sleep in the carriage and found myself here, I can go
anywhere from here.&nbsp; Where shall I go?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go
and look at the Junction by daylight.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
hurry, and I may like the look of one Line better than
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there were so many Lines.&nbsp; Gazing down upon them from
a bridge at the Junction, it was as if the concentrating
Companies formed a great Industrial Exhibition of the works of
extraordinary ground-spiders that spun iron.&nbsp; And then so
many of the Lines went such wonderful ways, so crossing and
curving among one another, that the eye lost them.&nbsp; And then
some of them appeared to start with the fixed intention of going
five hundred miles, and all of a sudden gave it up at an
insignificant barrier, or turned off into a <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>workshop.&nbsp; And then others, like intoxicated men,
went a little way very straight, and surprisingly slued round and
came back again.&nbsp; And then others were so chock-full of
trucks of coal, others were so blocked with trucks of casks,
others were so gorged with trucks of ballast, others were so set
apart for wheeled objects like immense iron cotton-reels: while
others were so bright and clear, and others were so delivered
over to rust and ashes and idle wheelbarrows out of work, with
their legs in the air (looking much like their masters on
strike), that there was no beginning, middle, or end, to the
bewilderment.</p>
<p>Barbox Brothers stood puzzled on the bridge, passing his right
hand across the lines on his forehead, which multiplied while he
looked down, as if the railway Lines were getting themselves
photographed on that sensitive plate.&nbsp; Then, was heard a
distant ringing of bells and blowing of whistles.&nbsp; Then,
puppet-looking heads of men popped out of boxes in perspective,
and popped in again.&nbsp; Then, prodigious wooden razors set up
on end, began shaving the atmosphere.&nbsp; Then, several
locomotive engines in several directions began to scream and be
agitated.&nbsp; Then, along one avenue a train came in.&nbsp;
Then, along another two trains appeared that didn&rsquo;t come
in, but stopped without.&nbsp; Then, bits of trains broke <!--
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>off.&nbsp; Then, a struggling horse became involved with
them.&nbsp; Then, the locomotives shared the bits of trains, and
ran away with the whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not made my next move much clearer by
this.&nbsp; No hurry.&nbsp; No need to make up my mind to-day, or
to-morrow, nor yet the day after.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take a
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It fell out somehow (perhaps he meant it should) that the walk
tended to the platform at which he had alighted, and to
Lamps&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; But Lamps was not in his room.&nbsp; A
pair of velveteen shoulders were adapting themselves to one of
the impressions on the wall by Lamps&rsquo;s fireplace, but
otherwise the room was void.&nbsp; In passing back to get out of
the station again, he learnt the cause of this vacancy, by
catching sight of Lamps on the opposite line of railway, skipping
along the top of a train, from carriage to carriage, and catching
lighted namesakes thrown up to him by a coadjutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is busy.&nbsp; He has not much time for composing or
singing Comic Songs this morning, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The direction he pursued now, was into the country, keeping
very near to the side of one great Line of railway, and within
easy view of others.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have half a mind,&rdquo; he
said, glancing around, &ldquo;to settle the question from this
point, by saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take this set <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of
rails, or that, or t&rsquo;other, and stick to it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They separate themselves from the confusion, out here, and go
their ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ascending a gentle hill of some extent, he came to a few
cottages.&nbsp; There, looking about him as a very reserved man
might who had never looked about him in his life before, he saw
some six or eight young children come merrily trooping and
whooping from one of the cottages, and disperse.&nbsp; But not
until they had all turned at the little garden gate, and kissed
their hands to a face at the upper window: a low window enough,
although the upper, for the cottage had but a story of one room
above the ground.</p>
<p>Now, that the children should do this was nothing; but that
they should do this to a face lying on the sill of the open
window, turned towards them in a horizontal position, and
apparently only a face, was something noticeable.&nbsp; He looked
up at the window again.&nbsp; Could only see a very fragile
though a very bright face, lying on one cheek on the
window-sill.&nbsp; The delicate smiling face of a girl or
woman.&nbsp; Framed in long bright brown hair, round which was
tied a light blue band or fillet, passing under the chin.</p>
<p>He walked on, turned back, passed the window again, shyly
glanced up again.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; He struck off by a
winding branch-road at the top of the hill&mdash;which he must
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>otherwise have descended&mdash;kept the cottages in
view, worked his way round at a distance so as to come out once
more into the main road and be obliged to pass the cottages
again.&nbsp; The face still lay on the window-sill, but not so
much inclined towards him.&nbsp; And now there were a pair of
delicate hands too.&nbsp; They had the action of performing on
some musical instrument, and yet it produced no sound that
reached his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mugby Junction must be the maddest place in
England,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, pursuing his way down the
hill.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first thing I find here is a Railway
Porter who composes comic songs to sing at his bedside.&nbsp; The
second thing I find here is a face, and a pair of hands playing a
musical instrument that don&rsquo;t play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was a fine bright day in the early beginning of
November, the air was clear and inspiriting, and the landscape
was rich in beautiful colours.&nbsp; The prevailing colours in
the court off Lombard-street, London city, had been few and
sombre.&nbsp; Sometimes, when the weather elsewhere was very
bright indeed, the dwellers in those tents enjoyed a
pepper-and-salt-coloured day or two, but their atmosphere&rsquo;s
usual wear was slate, or snuff colour.</p>
<p>He relished his walk so well, that he repeated it next
day.&nbsp; He was a little earlier at the cottage than on the day
before, and he <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>could hear the children up-stairs
singing to a regular measure and clapping out the time with their
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, there is no sound of any musical
instrument,&rdquo; he said, listening at the corner, &ldquo;and
yet I saw the performing hands again, as I came by.&nbsp; What
are the children singing?&nbsp; Why, good Lord, they can never be
singing the multiplication-table!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were though, and with infinite enjoyment.&nbsp; The
mysterious face had a voice attached to it which occasionally led
or set the children right.&nbsp; Its musical cheerfulness was
delightful.&nbsp; The measure at length stopped, and was
succeeded by a murmuring of young voices, and then by a short
song which he made out to be about the current month of the year,
and about what work it yielded to the labourers in the fields and
farm-yards.&nbsp; Then, there was a stir of little feet, and the
children came trooping and whooping out, as on the previous
day.&nbsp; And again, as on the previous day, they all turned at
the garden gate, and kissed their hands&mdash;evidently to the
face on the window-sill, though Barbox Brothers from his retired
post of disadvantage at the corner could not see it.</p>
<p>But as the children dispersed, he cut off one small
straggler&mdash;a brown faced boy with flaxen hair&mdash;and said
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, little one.&nbsp; Tell me whose house is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>The child, with one swarthy arm held up across his eyes,
half in shyness, and half ready for defence, said from behind the
inside of his elbow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, quite as much
embarrassed by his part in the dialogue as the child could
possibly be by his, &ldquo;is Ph&oelig;be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the child made answer: &ldquo;Why, Ph&oelig;be, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small but sharp observer had eyed his questioner closely,
and had taken his moral measure.&nbsp; He lowered his guard, and
rather assumed a tone with him: as having discovered him to be an
unaccustomed person in the art of polite conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ph&oelig;be,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t
be anybobby else but Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Can she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the child, &ldquo;then why did
you ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeming it prudent to shift his ground, Barbox Brothers took
up a new position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do there?&nbsp; Up there in that room where
the open window is.&nbsp; What do you do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; said the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Co-o-ol,&rdquo; the child repeated in a louder voice,
lengthening out the word with a fixed <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>look and
great emphasis, as much as to say: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of
your having grown up, if you&rsquo;re such a donkey as not to
understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; School, school,&rdquo; said Barbox
Brothers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes.&nbsp; And Ph&oelig;be
teaches you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tound it out, have you?&rdquo; said the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have found it out.&nbsp; What would you do with
twopence, if I gave it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knock-down promptitude of this reply leaving him not a leg
to stand upon, Barbox Brothers produced the twopence with great
lameness, and withdrew in a state of humiliation.</p>
<p>But, seeing the face on the window-sill as he passed the
cottage, he acknowledged its presence there with a gesture, which
was not a nod, not a bow, not a removal of his hat from his head,
but was a diffident compromise between or struggle with all
three.&nbsp; The eyes in the face seemed amused, or cheered, or
both, and the lips modestly said: &ldquo;Good day to you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find I must stick for a time to Mugby
Junction,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, with much gravity, after
once more stopping on his return road to look at the Lines where
they went their several ways so quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t make up my <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>mind yet, which iron road to
take.&nbsp; In fact, I must get a little accustomed to the
Junction before I can decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, he announced at the Inn that he was &ldquo;going to stay
on, for the present,&rdquo; and improved his acquaintance with
the Junction that night, and again next morning, and again next
night and morning: going down to the station, mingling with the
people there, looking about him down all the avenues of railway,
and beginning to take an interest in the incomings and outgoings
of the trains.&nbsp; At first, he often put his head into
Lamps&rsquo;s little room, but he never found Lamps there.&nbsp;
A pair or two of velveteen shoulders he usually found there,
stooping over the fire, sometimes in connexion with a clasped
knife and a piece of bread and meat; but the answer to his
inquiry, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Lamps?&rdquo; was, either that he
was &ldquo;t&rsquo;other side the line,&rdquo; or, that it was
his off-time, or (in the latter case), his own personal
introduction to another Lamps who was not his Lamps.&nbsp;
However, he was not so desperately set upon seeing Lamps now, but
he bore the disappointment.&nbsp; Nor did he so wholly devote
himself to his severe application to the study of Mugby Junction,
as to neglect exercise.&nbsp; On the contrary, he took a walk
every day, and always the same walk.&nbsp; But the weather turned
cold and wet again, and the window was never open.</p>
<h3><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>III</h3>
<p>At length, after a lapse of some days, there came another
streak of fine bright hardy autumn weather.&nbsp; It was a
Saturday.&nbsp; The window was open, and the children were
gone.&nbsp; Not surprising, this, for he had patiently watched
and waited at the corner, until they <i>were</i> gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; he said to the face; absolutely
getting his hat clear off his head this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day to you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have a fine sky again, to look
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&nbsp; It is kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an invalid, I fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I have very good health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you not always lying down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, I am always lying down, because I cannot sit
up.&nbsp; But I am not an invalid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laughing eyes seemed highly to enjoy his great
mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind taking the trouble to come in,
sir?&nbsp; There is a beautiful view from this window.&nbsp; And
you would see that I am not at all ill&mdash;being so good as to
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said to help him, as he stood irresolute, but evidently
desiring to enter, with his diffident hand on the latch of the
garden gate.&nbsp; It did help him, and he went in.</p>
<p>The room up-stairs was a very clean white <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>room with a
low roof.&nbsp; Its only inmate lay on a couch that brought her
face on a level with the window.&nbsp; The couch was white too;
and her simple dress or wrapper being light blue, like the band
around her hair, she had an ethereal look, and a fanciful
appearance of lying among clouds.&nbsp; He felt that she
instinctively perceived him to be by habit a downcast taciturn
man; it was another help to him to have established that
understanding so easily, and got it over.</p>
<p>There was an awkward constraint upon him, nevertheless, as he
touched her hand, and took a chair at the side of her couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see now,&rdquo; he began, not at all fluently,
&ldquo;how you occupy your hands.&nbsp; Only seeing you from the
path outside, I thought you were playing upon
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was engaged in very nimbly and dexterously making
lace.&nbsp; A lace-pillow lay upon her breast; and the quick
movements and changes of her hands upon it as she worked, had
given them the action he had misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is curious,&rdquo; she answered, with a bright
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I often fancy, myself, that I play tunes
while I am at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any musical knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could pick out tunes, if I had any
instrument, which could be made as handy to <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>me as my
lace-pillow.&nbsp; But I dare say I deceive myself.&nbsp; At all
events, I shall never know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a musical voice.&nbsp; Excuse me; I have heard
you sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the children?&rdquo; she answered, slightly
colouring.&nbsp; &ldquo;O yes.&nbsp; I sing with the dear
children, if it can be called singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbox Brothers glanced at the two small forms in the room,
and hazarded the speculation that she was fond of children, and
that she was learned in new systems of teaching them?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very fond of them,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head
again; &ldquo;but I know nothing of teaching, beyond the interest
I have in it, and the pleasure it gives me when they learn.&nbsp;
Perhaps your overhearing my little scholars sing some of their
lessons, has led you so far astray as to think me a grand
teacher?&nbsp; Ah! I thought so!&nbsp; No, I have only read and
been told about that system.&nbsp; It seemed so pretty and
pleasant, and to treat them so like the merry Robins they are,
that I took up with it in my little way.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
need to be told what a very little way mine is, sir,&rdquo; she
added, with a glance at the small forms and round the room.</p>
<p>All this time her hands were busy at her lace-pillow.&nbsp; As
they still continued so, and as there was a kind of substitute
for conversation in the click and play of its pegs, Barbox
Brothers took the opportunity of observing her.&nbsp; He guessed
her to be thirty.&nbsp; The charm of <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>her
transparent face and large bright brown eyes, was, not that they
were passively resigned, but that they were actively and
thoroughly cheerful.&nbsp; Even her busy hands, which of their
own thinness alone might have besought compassion, plied their
task with a gay courage that made mere compassion an
unjustifiable assumption of superiority, and an impertinence.</p>
<p>He saw her eyes in the act of rising towards his, and he
directed his towards the prospect, saying: &ldquo;Beautiful
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most beautiful, sir.&nbsp; I have sometimes had a fancy
that I would like to sit up, for once, only to try how it looks
to an erect head.&nbsp; But what a foolish fancy that would be to
encourage!&nbsp; It cannot look more lovely to any one than it
does to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were turned to it as she spoke, with most delighted
admiration and enjoyment.&nbsp; There was not a trace in it of
any sense of deprivation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those threads of railway, with their puffs of smoke
and steam changing places so fast, make it so lively for
me,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think of the number of
people who <i>can</i> go where they wish, on their business, or
their pleasure; I remember that the puffs make signs to me that
they are actually going while I look; and that enlivens the
prospect with abundance of company, if I want company.&nbsp;
There is the great Junction, too.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>it under the foot of the hill, but I can very often hear
it, and I always know it is there.&nbsp; It seems to join me, in
a way, to I don&rsquo;t know how many places and things that
<i>I</i> shall never see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an abashed kind of idea that it might have already joined
himself to something he had never seen, he said constrainedly:
&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you see, sir,&rdquo; pursued Ph&oelig;be,
&ldquo;I am not the invalid you thought me, and I am very well
off indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a happy disposition,&rdquo; said Barbox
Brothers: perhaps with a slight excusatory touch for his own
disposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; But you should know my father,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;His is the happy
disposition!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t mind, sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; For his
reserve took the alarm at a step upon the stairs, and he
distrusted that he would be set down for a troublesome
intruder.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my father coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened, and the father paused there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lamps!&rdquo; exclaimed Barbox Brothers, starting
from his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you do, Lamps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which, Lamps responded: &ldquo;The gentleman for
Nowhere!&nbsp; How do you <span class="smcap">do</span>,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they shook hands, to the greatest admiration and surprise
of Lamps&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have looked you up, half a dozen times <!-- page
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>since
that night,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, &ldquo;but have never
found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heerd on, sir, so I&rsquo;ve heerd
on,&rdquo; returned Lamps.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your being
noticed so often down at the Junction, without taking any train,
that has begun to get you the name among us of the gentleman for
Nowhere.&nbsp; No offence in my having called you by it when took
by surprise, I hope, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as good a name for me as
any other you could call me by.&nbsp; But may I ask you a
question in the corner here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamps suffered himself to be led aside from his
daughter&rsquo;s couch, by one of the buttons of his velveteen
jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the bedside where you sing your
songs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamps nodded.</p>
<p>The gentleman for Nowhere clapped him on the shoulder; and
they faced about again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, my dear,&rdquo; said Lamps then to his
daughter, looking from her to her visitor, &ldquo;it is such an
amaze to me, to find you brought acquainted with this gentleman,
that I must (if this gentleman will excuse me) take a
rounder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lamps demonstrated in action what this meant, by pulling
out his oily handkerchief rolled up in the form of a ball, and
giving himself an elaborate smear, from behind the <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>right
ear, up the cheek, across the forehead, and down the other cheek
to behind his left ear.&nbsp; After this operation he shone
exceedingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s according to my custom when particular
warmed up by any agitation, sir,&rdquo; he offered by way of
apology.&nbsp; &ldquo;And really, I am throwed into that state of
amaze by finding you brought acquainted with Ph&oelig;be, that
I&mdash;that I think I will, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, take
another rounder.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which he did, seeming to be greatly
restored by it.</p>
<p>They were now both standing by the side of her couch, and she
was working at her lace-pillow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your daughter tells
me,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, still in a half reluctant
shamefaced way, &ldquo;that she never sits up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, nor never has done.&nbsp; You see, her mother
(who died when she was a year and two months old) was subject to
very bad fits, and as she had never mentioned to me that she
<i>was</i> subject to fits, they couldn&rsquo;t be guarded
against.&nbsp; Consequently, she dropped the baby when took, and
this happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very wrong of her,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers,
with a knitted brow, &ldquo;to marry you, making a secret of her
infirmity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; pleaded Lamps, in behalf of the
long-deceased.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, Ph&oelig;be and me, we have
talked that over too.&nbsp; And Lord bless us!&nbsp; Such a
number on us has our infirmities, <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>what with
fits, and what with misfits, of one sort and another, that if we
confessed to &rsquo;em all before we got married, most of us
might never get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might not that be for the better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this case, sir,&rdquo; said Ph&oelig;be, giving
her hand to her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not in this case, sir,&rdquo; said her father,
patting it between his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You correct me,&rdquo; returned Barbox Brothers, with a
blush; &ldquo;and I must look so like a Brute, that at all events
it would be superfluous in me to confess to <i>that</i>
infirmity.&nbsp; I wish you would tell me a little more about
yourselves.&nbsp; I hardly know how to ask it of you, for I am
conscious that I have a bad stiff manner, a dull discouraging way
with me, but I wish you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all our hearts, sir,&rdquo; returned Lamps, gaily,
for both.&nbsp; &ldquo;And first of all, that you may know my
name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; interposed the visitor, with a slight
flush.&nbsp; &ldquo;What signifies your name!&nbsp; Lamps is name
enough for me.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; It is bright and
expressive.&nbsp; What do I want more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why to be sure, sir,&rdquo; returned Lamps.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have in general no other name down at the Junction; but
I thought, on account of your being here as a first-class single,
in a private character, that you might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>The visitor waved the thought away with his hand, and
Lamps acknowledged the mark of confidence by taking another
rounder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hard-worked, I take for granted?&rdquo; said
Barbox Brothers, when the subject of the rounder came out of it
much dirtier than he went into it.</p>
<p>Lamps was beginning, &ldquo;Not particular
so&rdquo;&mdash;when his daughter took him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, sir, he is very hard-worked.&nbsp; Fourteen,
fifteen, eighteen, hours a day.&nbsp; Sometimes twenty-four hours
at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, &ldquo;what with
your school, Ph&oelig;be, and what with your
lace-making&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my school is a pleasure to me,&rdquo; she
interrupted, opening her brown eyes wider, as if surprised to
find him so obtuse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I began it when I was but a
child, because it brought me and other children into company,
don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; <i>That</i> was not work.&nbsp; I
carry it on still, because it keeps children about me.&nbsp;
<i>That</i> is not work.&nbsp; I do it as love, not as
work.&nbsp; Then my lace-pillow;&rdquo; her busy hands had
stopped, as if her argument required all her cheerful
earnestness, but now went on again at the name; &ldquo;it goes
with my thoughts when I think, and it goes with my tunes when I
hum any, and <i>that&rsquo;s</i> not work.&nbsp; Why, you
yourself thought it was music, you know, sir.&nbsp; And so it is,
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;Everything is!&rdquo; cried Lamps,
radiantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything is music to her,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is, at any rate,&rdquo; said Ph&oelig;be,
exultingly pointing her thin forefinger at him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is more music in my father than there is in a brass
band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&nbsp; My dear!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
fillyillially done, you know; but you are flattering your
father,&rdquo; he protested, sparkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I am not, sir, I assure you.&nbsp; No I am
not.&nbsp; If you could hear my father sing, you would know I am
not.&nbsp; But you never will hear him sing, because he never
sings to any one but me.&nbsp; However tired he is, he always
sings to me when he comes home.&nbsp; When I lay here long ago,
quite a poor little broken doll, he used to sing to me.&nbsp;
More than that, he used to make songs, bringing in whatever
little jokes we had between us.&nbsp; More than that, he often
does so to this day.&nbsp; O! I&rsquo;ll tell of you, father, as
the gentleman has asked about you.&nbsp; He is a poet,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wish the gentleman, my dear,&rdquo;
observed Lamps, for the moment turning grave, &ldquo;to carry
away that opinion of your father, because it might look as if I
was given to asking the stars in a molloncolly manner what they
was up to.&nbsp; Which I wouldn&rsquo;t at once waste the time,
and take the liberty, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; resumed Ph&oelig;be, amending her
text, &ldquo;is always on the bright side, and the <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>good
side.&nbsp; You told me just now, I had a happy
disposition.&nbsp; How can I help it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! but my dear,&rdquo; returned Lamps
argumentatively, &ldquo;how can <i>I</i> help it?&nbsp; Put it to
yourself, sir.&nbsp; Look at her.&nbsp; Always as you see her
now.&nbsp; Always working&mdash;and after all, sir, for but a
very few shillings a week&mdash;always contented, always lively,
always interested in others, of all sorts.&nbsp; I said, this
moment, she was always as you see her now.&nbsp; So she is, with
a difference that comes to much the same.&nbsp; For, when
it&rsquo;s my Sunday off and the morning bells have done ringing,
I hear the prayers and thanks read in the touchingest way, and I
have the hymns sung to me&mdash;so soft, sir, that you
couldn&rsquo;t hear &rsquo;em out of this room&mdash;in notes
that seem to me, I am sure, to come from Heaven and go back to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might have been merely through the association of these
words with their sacredly quiet time, or it might have been
through the larger association of the words with the
Redeemer&rsquo;s presence beside the bedridden; but here her
dexterous fingers came to a stop on the lace-pillow, and clasped
themselves round his neck as he bent down.&nbsp; There was great
natural sensibility in both father and daughter, the visitor
could easily see; but each made it, for the other&rsquo;s sake,
retiring, not demonstrative; and perfect cheerfulness, intuitive
or acquired, was either the first or second nature of both.&nbsp;
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>In a very few moments, Lamps was taking another rounder
with his comical features beaming, while Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
laughing eyes (just a glistening speck or so upon their lashes)
were again directed by turns to him, and to her work, and to
Barbox Brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my father, sir,&rdquo; she said brightly,
&ldquo;tells you about my being interested in other people even
though they know nothing about me&mdash;which, by-the-by, I told
you myself&mdash;you ought to know how that comes about.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe him, sir; yes, it is.&nbsp; He
tells me of everything he sees down at his work.&nbsp; You would
be surprised what a quantity he gets together for me every
day.&nbsp; He looks into the carriages, and tells me how the
ladies are drest&mdash;so that I know all the fashions!&nbsp; He
looks into the carriages, and tells me what pairs of lovers he
sees, and what new-married couples on their wedding trip&mdash;so
that I know all about that!&nbsp; He collects chance newspapers
and books&mdash;so that I have plenty to read!&nbsp; He tells me
about the sick people who are travelling to try to get
better&mdash;so that I know all about them!&nbsp; In short, as I
began by saying, he tells me everything he sees and makes out,
down at his work, and you can&rsquo;t think what a quantity he
does see and make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;As to collecting newspapers and books, my
dear,&rdquo; said Lamps, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s clear I can have no
merit in that, because they&rsquo;re not my perquisites.&nbsp;
You see, sir, it&rsquo;s this way: A Guard, he&rsquo;ll say to
me, &lsquo;Hallo, here you are, Lamps.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve saved
this paper for your daughter.&nbsp; How is she agoing
on?&rsquo;&nbsp; A Head-Porter, he&rsquo;ll say to me,
&lsquo;Here!&nbsp; Catch hold, Lamps.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a couple
of wollumes for your daughter.&nbsp; Is she pretty much where she
were?&rsquo;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what makes it double welcome,
you see.&nbsp; If she had a thousand pound in&rsquo; a box, they
wouldn&rsquo;t trouble themselves about her; but being what she
is&mdash;that is, you understand,&rdquo; Lamps added, somewhat
hurriedly, &ldquo;not having a thousand pound in a box&mdash;they
take thought for her.&nbsp; And as concerning the young pairs,
married and unmarried, it&rsquo;s only natural I should bring
home what little I can about <i>them</i>, seeing that
there&rsquo;s not a Couple of either sort in the neighbourhood
that don&rsquo;t come of their own accord to confide in
Ph&oelig;be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes triumphantly to Barbox Brothers, as she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, that is true.&nbsp; If I could have got up
and gone to church, I don&rsquo;t know how often I should have
been a bridesmaid.&nbsp; But if I could have done that, some
girls in love might have been jealous of me, and as it is, no
girl is jealous of me.&nbsp; And my pillow would <!-- page
37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>not
have been half as ready to put the piece of cake under, as I
always find it,&rdquo; she added, turning her face on it with a
light sigh, and a smile at her father.</p>
<p>The arrival of a little girl, the biggest of the scholars, now
led to an understanding on the part of Barbox Brothers, that she
was the domestic of the cottage, and had come to take active
measures in it, attended by a pail that might have extinguished
her, and a broom three times her height.&nbsp; He therefore rose
to take his leave, and took it; saying that if Ph&oelig;be had no
objection, he would come again.</p>
<p>He had muttered that he would come &ldquo;in the course of his
walks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The course of his walks must have been highly
favourable to his return, for he returned after an interval of a
single day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you would never see me any more, I
suppose?&rdquo; he said to Ph&oelig;be as he touched her hand,
and sat down by her couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I think so!&rdquo; was her surprised
rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took it for granted you would mistrust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For granted, sir?&nbsp; Have you been so much
mistrusted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am justified in answering yes.&nbsp; But I
may have mistrusted too, on my part.&nbsp; <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>No matter
just now.&nbsp; We were speaking of the Junction last time.&nbsp;
I have passed hours there since the day before
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you now the gentleman for Somewhere?&rdquo; she
asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly for Somewhere; but I don&rsquo;t yet know
Where.&nbsp; You would never guess what I am travelling
from.&nbsp; Shall I tell you?&nbsp; I am travelling from my
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hands stopped in her work, and she looked at him with
incredulous astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, not quite easy in his
chair, &ldquo;from my birthday.&nbsp; I am, to myself, an
unintelligible book with the earlier chapters all torn out, and
thrown away.&nbsp; My childhood had no grace of childhood, my
youth had no charm of youth, and what can be expected from such a
lost beginning?&rdquo;&nbsp; His eyes meeting hers as they were
addressed intently to him, something seemed to stir within his
breast, whispering: &ldquo;Was this bed a place for the graces of
childhood and the charms of youth to take to, kindly?&nbsp; O
shame, shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a disease with me,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers,
checking himself, and making as though he had a difficulty in
swallowing something, &ldquo;to go wrong about that.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how I came to speak of that.&nbsp; I hope it is
because of an old misplaced confidence in <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>one of your
sex involving an old bitter treachery.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I am all wrong together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hands quietly and slowly resumed their work.&nbsp;
Glancing at her, he saw that her eyes were thoughtfully following
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am travelling from my birthday,&rdquo; he resumed,
&ldquo;because it has always been a dreary day to me.&nbsp; My
first free birthday coming round some five or six weeks hence, I
am travelling to put its predecessors far behind me, and to try
to crush the day&mdash;or, at all events, put it out of my
sight&mdash;by heaping new objects on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he paused, she looked at him; but only shook her head as
being quite at a loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is unintelligible to your happy
disposition,&rdquo; he pursued, abiding by his former phrase as
if there were some lingering virtue of self-defence in it:
&ldquo;I knew it would be, and am glad it is.&nbsp; However, on
this travel of mine (in which I mean to pass the rest of my days,
having abandoned all thought of a fixed home), I stopped, as you
heard from your father, at the Junction here.&nbsp; The extent of
its ramifications quite confused me as to whither I should go,
<i>from</i> here.&nbsp; I have not yet settled, being still
perplexed among so many roads.&nbsp; What do you think I mean to
do?&nbsp; How many of the branching roads can you see from your
window?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Looking out, full of interest, she answered,
&ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, watching her with a
grave smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well! I propose to myself, at once to
reduce the gross number to those very seven, and gradually to
fine them down to one&mdash;the most promising for me&mdash;and
to take that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you know, sir, which is the most
promising?&rdquo; she asked, with her brightened eyes roving over
the view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, with another grave
smile, and considerably improving in his ease of speech.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To be sure.&nbsp; In this way.&nbsp; Where your father can
pick up so much every day for a good purpose, I may once and
again pick up a little for an indifferent purpose.&nbsp; The
gentleman for Nowhere must become still better known at the
Junction.&nbsp; He shall continue to explore it, until he
attaches something that he has seen, heard, or found out, at the
head of each of the seven roads, to the road itself.&nbsp; And so
his choice of a road shall be determined by his choice among his
discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hands still busy, she again glanced at the prospect, as if
it comprehended something that had not been in it before, and
laughed as if it yielded her new pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not forget,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers,
&ldquo;(having got so far) to ask a favour.&nbsp; <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>I
want your help in this expedient of mine.&nbsp; I want to bring
you what I pick up at the heads of the seven roads that you lie
here looking out at, and to compare notes with you about
it.&nbsp; May I?&nbsp; They say two heads are better than
one.&nbsp; I should say myself that probably depends upon the
heads concerned.&nbsp; But I am quite sure, though we are so
newly acquainted, that your head and your father&rsquo;s have
found out better things, Ph&oelig;be, than ever mine of itself
discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her sympathetic right hand, in perfect rapture
with his proposal, and eagerly and gratefully thanked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Again I must not forget (having got so far) to ask a
favour.&nbsp; Will you shut your eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing playfully at the strange nature of the request, she
did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep them shut,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, going
softly to the door, and coming back.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are on your
honour, mind, not to open your eyes until I tell you that you
may?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; On my honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&nbsp; May I take your lace-pillow from you for a
minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still laughing and wondering, she removed her hands from it,
and he put it aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me.&nbsp; Did you see the puffs of smoke and steam
made by the morning fast-train yesterday on road number seven
from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&ldquo;Behind the elm-trees and the spire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the road,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers,
directing his eyes towards it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I watched them melt away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything unusual in what they expressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she answered merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not complimentary to me, for I was in that train.&nbsp;
I went&mdash;don&rsquo;t open your eyes&mdash;to fetch you this,
from the great ingenious town.&nbsp; It is not half so large as
your lace-pillow, and lies easily and lightly in its place.&nbsp;
These little keys are like the keys of a miniature piano, and you
supply the air required with your left hand.&nbsp; May you pick
out delightful music from it, my dear!&nbsp; For the
present&mdash;you can open your eyes
now&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his embarrassed way, he closed the door upon himself, and
only saw, in doing so, that she ecstatically took the present to
her bosom and caressed it.&nbsp; The glimpse gladdened his heart,
and yet saddened it; for so might she, if her youth had
flourished in its natural course, have taken to her breast that
day the slumbering music of her own child&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<h2><!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>BARBOX BROTHERS AND CO.</h2>
<p>With good will and earnest purpose, the gentleman for Nowhere
began, on the very next day, his researches at the heads of the
seven roads.&nbsp; The results of his researches, as he and
Ph&oelig;be afterwards set them down in fair writing, hold their
due places in this veracious chronicle, from its seventeenth
page, onward.&nbsp; But they occupied a much longer time in the
getting together than they ever will in the perusal.&nbsp; And
this is probably the case with most reading matter, except when
it is of that highly beneficial kind (for Posterity) which is
&ldquo;thrown off in a few moments of leisure&rdquo; by the
superior poetic geniuses who scorn to take prose pains.</p>
<p>It must be admitted, however, that Barbox by no means hurried
himself.&nbsp; His heart being in his work of good-nature, he
revelled in it.&nbsp; There was the joy, too (it was a true joy
to him), of sometimes sitting by, listening to Ph&oelig;be as she
picked out more and more discourse from her musical instrument,
and as <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>her natural taste and ear refined
daily upon her first discoveries.&nbsp; Besides being a pleasure,
this was an occupation, and in the course of weeks it consumed
hours.&nbsp; It resulted that his dreaded birthday was close upon
him before he had troubled himself any more about it.</p>
<p>The matter was made more pressing by the unforeseen
circumstance that the councils held (at which Mr. Lamps, beaming
most brilliantly, on a few rare occasions assisted) respecting
the road to be selected, were, after all, in no wise assisted by
his investigations.&nbsp; For, he had connected this interest
with this road, or that interest with the other, but could deduce
no reason from it for giving any road the preference.&nbsp;
Consequently, when the last council was holden, that part of the
business stood, in the end, exactly where it had stood in the
beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; remarked Ph&oelig;be, &ldquo;we have
only six roads after all.&nbsp; Is the seventh road
dumb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seventh road?&nbsp; O!&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers,
rubbing his chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the road I took, you know,
when I went to get your little present.&nbsp; That is <i>its</i>
story, Ph&oelig;be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind taking that road again, sir?&rdquo; she
asked with hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least; it is a great high road after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&ldquo;I should like you to take it,&rdquo; returned
Ph&oelig;be, with a persuasive smile, &ldquo;for the love of that
little present which must ever be so dear to me.&nbsp; I should
like you to take it, because that road can never be again, like
any other road to me.&nbsp; I should like you to take it, in
remembrance of your having done me so much good: of your having
made me so much happier!&nbsp; If you leave me by the road you
travelled when you went to do me this great kindness,&rdquo;
sounding a faint chord as she spoke, &ldquo;I shall feel, lying
here watching at my window, as if it must conduct you to a
prosperous end, and bring you back some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done, my dear; it shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So at last the gentleman for Nowhere took a ticket for
Somewhere, and his destination was the great ingenious town.</p>
<p>He had loitered so long about the Junction that it was the
eighteenth of December when he left it.&nbsp; &ldquo;High
time,&rdquo; he reflected, as he seated himself in the train,
&ldquo;that I started in earnest!&nbsp; Only one clear day
remains between me and the day I am running away from.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll push onward for the hill-country to-morrow.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go to Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with some pains that he placed before himself the
undeniable advantages to be gained in the way of novel occupation
for his senses from misty mountains, swollen streams, rain, <!--
page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>cold, a wild seashore, and rugged roads.&nbsp; And yet
he scarcely made them out as distinctly as he could have
wished.&nbsp; Whether the poor girl, in spite of her new
resource, her music, would have any feeling of loneliness upon
her now&mdash;just at first&mdash;that she had not had before;
whether she saw those very puffs of steam and smoke that he saw,
as he sat in the train thinking of her; whether her face would
have any pensive shadow on it as they died out of the distant
view from her window; whether, in telling him he had done her so
much good, she had not unconsciously corrected his old moody
bemoaning of his station in life, by setting him thinking that a
man might be a great healer, if he would, and yet not be a great
doctor; these and other similar meditations got between him and
his Welsh picture.&nbsp; There was within him, too, that dull
sense of vacuity which follows separation from an object of
interest, and cessation of a pleasant pursuit; and this sense,
being quite new to him, made him restless.&nbsp; Further, in
losing Mugby Junction he had found himself again; and he was not
the more enamoured of himself for having lately passed his time
in better company.</p>
<p>But surely, here not far ahead, must be the great ingenious
town.&nbsp; This crashing and clashing that the train was
undergoing, and this coupling on to it of a multitude of new <!--
page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>echoes, could mean nothing less than approach to the
great station.&nbsp; It did mean nothing less.&nbsp; After some
stormy flashes of town lightning, in the way of swift revelations
of red-brick blocks of houses, high red-brick chimney-shafts,
vistas of red-brick railway arches, tongues of fire, blots of
smoke, valleys of canal, and hills of coal, there came the
thundering in at the journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>Having seen his portmanteaus safely housed in the hotel he
chose, and having appointed his dinner-hour, Barbox Brothers went
out for a walk in the busy streets.&nbsp; And now it began to be
suspected by him that Mugby Junction was a Junction of many
branches, invisible as well as visible, and had joined him to an
endless number of byways.&nbsp; For, whereas he would, but a
little while ago, have walked these streets blindly brooding, he
now had eyes and thoughts for a new external world.&nbsp; How the
many toiling people lived, and loved, and died; how wonderful it
was to consider the various trainings of eye and hand, the nice
distinctions of sight and touch, that separated them into classes
of workers, and even into classes of workers at subdivisions of
one complete whole which combined their many intelligences and
forces, though of itself but some cheap object of use or ornament
in common life; how good it was to know that such assembling in a
multitude on their part, <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and such
contribution of their several dexterities towards a civilising
end, did not deteriorate them as it was the fashion of the
supercilious May-flies of humanity to pretend, but engendered
among them a self-respect and yet a modest desire to be much
wiser than they were (the first evinced in their well-balanced
bearing and manner of speech when he stopped to ask a question;
the second, in the announcements of their popular studies and
amusements on the public walls); these considerations, and a host
of such, made his walk a memorable one.&nbsp; &ldquo;I too am but
a little part of a great whole,&rdquo; he began to think;
&ldquo;and to be serviceable to myself and others, or to be
happy, I must cast my interest into, and draw it out of, the
common stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he had arrived at his journey&rsquo;s end for the day
by noon, he had since insensibly walked about the town so far and
so long that the lamplighters were now at their work in the
streets, and the shops were sparkling up brilliantly.&nbsp; Thus
reminded to turn towards his quarters, he was in the act of doing
so, when a very little hand crept into his, and a very little
voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; If you please, I am lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down, and saw a very little fair-haired girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, confirming her words with a
serious nod.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am indeed.&nbsp; I am
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Greatly perplexed, he stopped, looked about him for
help, descried none, and said, bending low: &ldquo;Where do you
live, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I live,&rdquo; she
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your other name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply was prompt, but unintelligible.</p>
<p>Imitating the sound, as he caught it, he hazarded the guess,
&ldquo;Trivits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no!&rdquo; said the child, shaking her head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it again, little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unpromising business.&nbsp; For this time it had quite a
different sound.</p>
<p>He made the venture: &ldquo;Paddens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no!&rdquo; said the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more.&nbsp; Let us try it again, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A most hopeless business.&nbsp; This time it swelled into four
syllables.&nbsp; &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Tappitarver?&rdquo;
said Barbox Brothers, rubbing his head with his hat in
discomfiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the child quietly
assented.</p>
<p>On her trying this unfortunate name once more, with
extraordinary efforts at distinctness, it swelled into eight
syllables at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I think,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, with a
desperate air of resignation, &ldquo;that we had better give it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;But I am lost,&rdquo; said the child, nestling
her little hand more closely in his, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll take
care of me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If ever a man were disconcerted by division between compassion
on the one hand, and the very imbecility of irresolution on the
other, here the man was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; he repeated,
looking down at the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure <i>I</i>
am.&nbsp; What is to be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do <i>you</i> live?&rdquo; asked the child,
looking up at him, wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; he answered, pointing vaguely in the
direction of his hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better go there?&rdquo; said the
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
but what we had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they set off, hand in hand.&nbsp; He, through comparison of
himself against his little companion, with a clumsy feeling on
him as if he had just developed into a foolish giant.&nbsp; She,
clearly elevated in her own tiny opinion by having got him so
neatly out of his embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have dinner when we get there, I
suppose?&rdquo; said Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;I&mdash;yes, I suppose
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like your dinner?&rdquo; asked the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, on the whole,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers,
&ldquo;yes, I think I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;I do mine,&rdquo; said Polly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have
you any brothers and sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers.&nbsp; With that absurd
sense of unwieldiness of mind and body weighing him down, he
would have not known how to pursue the conversation beyond this
curt rejoinder, but that the child was always ready for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; she asked, turning her soft hand coaxingly
in his, &ldquo;are you going to do to amuse me, after
dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul, Polly,&rdquo; exclaimed Barbox Brothers,
very much at a loss, &ldquo;I have not the slightest
idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I tell you what,&rdquo; said Polly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you got any cards at your house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers, in a boastful
vein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll build houses, and you
shall look at me.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t blow, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no!&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,
no.&nbsp; No blowing.&nbsp; Blowing&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flattered himself that he had said this pretty well for an
idiotic Monster; but the child, instantly perceiving the
awkwardness of his attempt to adapt himself to her level, utterly
destroyed his hopeful opinion of himself <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>by saying,
compassionately: &ldquo;What a funny man you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling, after this melancholy failure, as if he every minute
grew bigger and heavier in person, and weaker in mind, Barbox
gave himself up for a bad job.&nbsp; No giant ever submitted more
meekly to be led in triumph by all-conquering Jack, than he to be
bound in slavery to Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any stories?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
<p>He was reduced to the humiliating confession:
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dunce you must be, mustn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
said Polly.</p>
<p>He was reduced to the humiliating confession:
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to teach you a story?&nbsp; But you
must remember it, you know, and be able to tell it right to
somebody else afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He professed that it would afford him the highest mental
gratification to be taught a story, and that he would humbly
endeavour to retain it in his mind.&nbsp; Whereupon Polly, giving
her hand a new little turn in his, expressive of settling down
for enjoyment, commenced a long romance, of which every relishing
clause began with the words: &ldquo;So this&rdquo; or &ldquo;And
so this.&rdquo;&nbsp; As, &ldquo;So this boy;&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;So this fairy;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;And so this pie was four
yards round, and two yards and a quarter deep.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!--
page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>The interest of the romance was derived from the
intervention of this fairy to punish this boy for having a greedy
appetite.&nbsp; To achieve which purpose, this fairy made this
pie, and this boy ate and ate and ate, and his cheeks swelled and
swelled and swelled.&nbsp; There were many tributary
circumstances, but the forcible interest culminated in the total
consumption of this pie, and the bursting of this boy.&nbsp;
Truly he was a fine sight, Barbox Brothers, with serious
attentive face, and ear bent down, much jostled on the pavements
of the busy town, but afraid of losing a single incident of the
epic, lest he should be examined in it by-and-by and found
deficient.</p>
<p>Thus they arrived at the hotel.&nbsp; And there he had to say
at the bar, and said awkwardly enough: &ldquo;I have found a
little girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole establishment turned out to look at the little
girl.&nbsp; Nobody knew her; nobody could make out her name, as
she set it forth&mdash;except one chambermaid, who said it was
Constantinople&mdash;which it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will dine with my young friend in a private
room,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers to the hotel authorities,
&ldquo;and perhaps you will be so good as let the police know
that the pretty baby is here.&nbsp; I suppose she is sure to be
inquired for, soon, if she has not been already.&nbsp; Come
along, Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perfectly at ease and peace, Polly came <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>along, but,
finding the stairs rather stiff work, was carried up by Barbox
Brothers.&nbsp; The dinner was a most transcendent success, and
the Barbox sheepishness, under Polly&rsquo;s directions how to
mince her meat for her, and how to diffuse gravy over the plate
with a liberal and equal hand, was another fine sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;while we are at
dinner, you be good, and tell me that story I taught
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the tremors of a civil service examination on him, and
very uncertain indeed, not only as to the epoch at which the pie
appeared in history, but also as to the measurements of that
indispensable fact, Barbox Brothers made a shaky beginning, but
under encouragement did very fairly.&nbsp; There was a want of
breadth observable in his rendering of the cheeks, as well as the
appetite, of the boy; and there was a certain tameness in his
fairy, referable to an under-current of desire to account for
her.&nbsp; Still, as the first lumbering performance of a
good-humoured monster, it passed muster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you to be good,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;and
you are good, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied Barbox Brothers.</p>
<p>Such was his deference that Polly, elevated on a platform of
sofa-cushions in a chair at his right hand, encouraged him with a
pat or two on the face from the greasy bowl of her spoon, and
even with a gracious kiss.&nbsp; In getting on <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>her feet upon
her chair, however, to give him this last reward, she toppled
forward among the dishes, and caused him to exclaim as he
effected her rescue: &ldquo;Gracious Angels!&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; I
thought we were in the fire, Polly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a coward you are, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Polly, when replaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am rather nervous,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whew!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t, Polly!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t flourish
your spoon, or you&rsquo;ll go over sideways.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tilt up your legs when you laugh, Polly, or you&rsquo;ll go over
backwards.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; Polly, Polly, Polly,&rdquo; said
Barbox Brothers, nearly succumbing to despair, &ldquo;we are
environed with dangers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, he could descry no security from the pitfalls that
were yawning for Polly, but in proposing to her, after dinner, to
sit upon a low stool.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, if you will,&rdquo;
said Polly.&nbsp; So, as peace of mind should go before all, he
begged the waiter to wheel aside the table, bring a pack of
cards, a couple of footstools, and a screen, and close in Polly
and himself before the fire, as it were in a snug room within the
room.&nbsp; Then, finest sight of all, was Barbox Brothers on his
footstool, with a pint decanter on the rug, contemplating Polly
as she built successfully, and growing blue in the face with
holding his breath, lest he should blow the house down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you stare, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Polly, in a
houseless pause.</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Detected in the ignoble fact, he felt obliged to admit,
apologetically: &ldquo;I am afraid I was looking rather hard at
you, Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stare?&rdquo; asked Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, &ldquo;recall
why.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be a simpleton to do things and not know why,
mustn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Polly.</p>
<p>In spite of which reproof, he looked at the child again,
intently, as she bent her head over her card-structure, her rich
curls shading her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;that I can ever have seen this pretty baby
before.&nbsp; Can I have dreamed of her?&nbsp; In some sorrowful
dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could make nothing of it.&nbsp; So he went into the
building trade as a journeyman under Polly, and they built three
stories high, four stories high: even five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say.&nbsp; Who do you think is coming?&rdquo; asked
Polly, rubbing her eyes after tea.</p>
<p>He guessed: &ldquo;The waiter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;the dustman.&nbsp; I am
getting sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new embarrassment for Barbox Brothers!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am going to be fetched
to-night,&rdquo; said Polly; &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought not, either.&nbsp; After another quarter of an
hour, the dustman not merely impending but actually arriving,
recourse was had to the Constantinopolitan chambermaid: <!-- page
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>who
cheerily undertook that the child should sleep in a comfortable
and wholesome room, which she herself would share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know you will be careful, won&rsquo;t you,&rdquo;
said Barbox Brothers, as a new fear dawned upon him, &ldquo;that
she don&rsquo;t fall out of bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly found this so highly entertaining that she was under the
necessity of clutching him round the neck with both arms as he
sat on his footstool picking up the cards, and rocking him to and
fro, with her dimpled chin on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O what a coward you are, ain&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; said
Polly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> fall out of bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;not generally, Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, Polly gave him a reassuring hug or two to keep him
going, and then giving that confiding mite of a hand of hers to
be swallowed up in the hand of the Constantinopolitan
chambermaid, trotted off, chattering, without a vestige of
anxiety.</p>
<p>He looked after her, had the screen removed and the table and
chairs replaced, and still looked after her.&nbsp; He paced the
room for half an hour.&nbsp; &ldquo;A most engaging little
creature, but it&rsquo;s not that.&nbsp; A most winning little
voice, but it&rsquo;s not that.&nbsp; That has much to do with
it, but there is something more.&nbsp; How can it be that I seem
to know this child?&nbsp; What <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>was it she
imperfectly recalled to me when I felt her touch in the street,
and, looking down at her, saw her looking up at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jackson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a start he turned towards the sound of the subdued voice,
and saw his answer standing at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mr. Jackson, do not be severe with me.&nbsp; Speak a
word of encouragement to me, I beseech you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Polly&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Polly herself might come to this, one day.&nbsp; As
you see what the rose was, in its faded leaves; as you see what
the summer growth of the woods was, in their wintry branches; so
Polly might be traced, one day, in a care-worn woman like this,
with her hair turned grey.&nbsp; Before him, were the ashes of a
dead fire that had once burned bright.&nbsp; This was the woman
he had loved.&nbsp; This was the woman he had lost.&nbsp; Such
had been the constancy of his imagination to her, so had Time
spared her under its withholding, that now, seeing how roughly
the inexorable hand had struck her, his soul was filled with pity
and amazement.</p>
<p>He led her to a chair, and stood leaning on a corner of the
chimney-piece, with his head resting on his hand, and his face
half averted.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;Did you see me in the street, and show me to your
child?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the little creature, then, a party to
deceit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there is no deceit.&nbsp; I said to her,
&lsquo;We have lost our way, and I must try to find mine by
myself.&nbsp; Go to that gentleman and tell him you are
lost.&nbsp; You shall be fetched by-and-by.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps
you have not thought how very young she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very self-reliant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps because she is so young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked, after a short pause, &ldquo;Why did you do
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mr. Jackson, do you ask me?&nbsp; In the hope that
you might see something in my innocent child to soften your heart
towards me.&nbsp; Not only towards me, but towards my
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly turned about, and walked to the opposite end of
the room.&nbsp; He came back again with a slower step, and
resumed his former attitude, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had emigrated to America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did.&nbsp; But life went ill with us there, and we
came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live in this town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I am a daily teacher of music here.&nbsp; My
husband is a book-keeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;forgive my asking&mdash;poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;We earn enough for our wants.&nbsp; That is not
our distress.&nbsp; My husband is very, very ill of a lingering
disorder.&nbsp; He will never recover&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You check yourself.&nbsp; If it is for want of the
encouraging word you spoke of, take it from me.&nbsp; I cannot
forget the old time, Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; she replied, with a burst of
tears, and gave him her trembling hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compose yourself.&nbsp; I cannot be composed if you are
not, for to see you weep distresses me beyond expression.&nbsp;
Speak freely to me.&nbsp; Trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shaded her face with her veil, and after a little while
spoke calmly.&nbsp; Her voice had the ring of Polly&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that my husband&rsquo;s mind is at all
impaired by his bodily suffering, for I assure you that is not
the case.&nbsp; But in his weakness, and in his knowledge that he
is incurably ill, he cannot overcome the ascendancy of one
idea.&nbsp; It preys upon him, embitters every moment of his
painful life, and will shorten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopping, he said again: &ldquo;Speak freely to me.&nbsp;
Trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had five children before this darling, and they
all lie in their little graves.&nbsp; He believes that they have
withered away under a curse, and that it will blight this child
like the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;Under what curse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both I and he have it on our conscience that we tried
you very heavily, and I do not know but that, if I were as ill as
he, I might suffer in my mind as he does.&nbsp; This is the
constant burden:&mdash;&lsquo;I believe, Beatrice, I was the only
friend that Mr. Jackson ever cared to make, though I was so much
his junior.&nbsp; The more influence he acquired in the business,
the higher he advanced me, and I was alone in his private
confidence.&nbsp; I came between him and you, and I took you from
him.&nbsp; We were both secret, and the blow fell when he was
wholly unprepared.&nbsp; The anguish it caused a man so
compressed, must have been terrible; the wrath it awakened,
inappeasable.&nbsp; So, a curse came to be invoked on our poor
pretty little flowers, and they fall.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Beatrice,&rdquo; he asked, when she had ceased
to speak, and there had been a silence afterwards: &ldquo;how say
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until within these few weeks I was afraid of you, and I
believed that you would never, never, forgive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until within these few weeks,&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you changed your opinion of me within these few
weeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was getting some pieces of music in a shop in this
town, when, to my terror, you <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>came
in.&nbsp; As I veiled my face and stood in the dark end of the
shop, I heard you explain that you wanted a musical instrument
for a bedridden girl.&nbsp; Your voice and manner were so
softened, you showed such interest in its selection, you took it
away yourself with so much tenderness of care and pleasure, that
I knew you were a man with a most gentle heart.&nbsp; O Mr.
Jackson, Mr. Jackson, if you could have felt the refreshing rain
of tears that followed for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was Ph&oelig;be playing at that moment, on her distant
couch?&nbsp; He seemed to hear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I inquired in the shop where you lived, but could get
no information.&nbsp; As I had heard you say that you were going
back by the next train (but you did not say where), I resolved to
visit the station at about that time of day, as often as I could,
between my lessons, on the chance of seeing you again.&nbsp; I
have been there very often, but saw you no more until
to-day.&nbsp; You were meditating as you walked the street, but
the calm expression of your face emboldened me to send my child
to you.&nbsp; And when I saw you bend your head to speak tenderly
to her, I prayed to <span class="smcap">God</span> to forgive me
for having ever brought a sorrow on it.&nbsp; I now pray to you
to forgive me, and to forgive my husband.&nbsp; I was very young,
he was young too, and in the ignorant hardihood of such a time of
life we don&rsquo;t know what we do to those <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>who have
undergone more discipline.&nbsp; You generous man!&nbsp; You good
man!&nbsp; So to raise me up and make nothing of my crime against
you!&rdquo;&mdash;for he would not see her on her knees, and
soothed her as a kind father might have soothed an erring
daughter&mdash;&ldquo;thank you, bless you, thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he next spoke, it was after having drawn aside the
window-curtain and looked out a while.&nbsp; Then, he only
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Polly asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; As I came in, I met her going away
up-stairs, and put her to bed myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave her with me for to-morrow, Beatrice, and write me
your address on this leaf of my pocket-book.&nbsp; In the evening
I will bring her home to you&mdash;and to her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Polly, putting her saucy sunny face
in at the door next morning when breakfast was ready: &ldquo;I
thought I was fetched last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were, Polly, but I asked leave to keep you here
for the day, and to take you home in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; said Polly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
very cool, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Polly seemed to think it a good idea, and added,
&ldquo;I suppose I must give you a kiss, though you <i>are</i>
cool.&rdquo;&nbsp; The kiss given <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>and taken,
they sat down to breakfast in a highly conversational tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you are going to amuse me?&rdquo; said
Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers.</p>
<p>In the pleasurable height of her anticipations, Polly found it
indispensable to put down her piece of toast, cross one of her
little fat knees over the other, and bring her little fat right
hand down into her left hand with a business-like slap.&nbsp;
After this gathering of herself together, Polly, by that time, a
mere heap of dimples, asked in a wheedling manner: &ldquo;What
are we going to do, you dear old thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I was thinking,&rdquo; said Barbox Brothers,
&ldquo;&mdash;but are you fond of horses, Polly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ponies, I am,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;especially when
their tails are long.&nbsp; But horses&mdash;n&mdash;no&mdash;too
big, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; pursued Barbox Brothers, in a spirit of
grave mysterious confidence adapted to the importance of the
consultation, &ldquo;I did see yesterday, Polly, on the walls,
pictures of two long-tailed ponies, speckled all
over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, <span class="smcap">no</span>!&rdquo; cried
Polly, in an ecstatic desire to linger on the charming
details.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not speckled all over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speckled all over.&nbsp; Which ponies jump through
hoops&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;No, no, <span class="smcap">no</span>!&rdquo;
cried Polly, as before.&nbsp; &ldquo;They never jump through
hoops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do.&nbsp; O I assure you, they do.&nbsp; And
eat pie in pinafores&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ponies eating pie in pinafores!&rdquo; said
Polly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a story-teller you are, ain&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour.&mdash;And fire off guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Polly hardly seemed to see the force of the ponies resorting
to fire-arms.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was thinking,&rdquo; pursued the exemplary
Barbox, &ldquo;that if you and I were to go to the Circus where
these ponies are, it would do our constitutions good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean, amuse us?&rdquo; inquired Polly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What long words you do use, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apologetic for having wandered out of his depth, he replied:
&ldquo;That means, amuse us.&nbsp; That is exactly what it
means.&nbsp; There are many other wonders besides the ponies, and
we shall see them all.&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen in spangled
dresses, and elephants and lions and tigers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly became observant of the teapot, with a curled-up nose
indicating some uneasiness of mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;They never get
out, of course,&rdquo; she remarked as a mere truism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elephants and lions and tigers?&nbsp; O dear
no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear no!&rdquo; said Polly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And of <!--
page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>course nobody&rsquo;s afraid of the ponies shooting
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not the least in the world,&rdquo; said
Polly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was also thinking,&rdquo; proceeded Barbox,
&ldquo;that if we were to look in at the toy-shop, to choose a
doll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dressed!&rdquo; cried Polly, with a clap of her
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, <span class="smcap">no</span>, not
dressed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full dressed.&nbsp; Together with a house, and all
things necessary for housekeeping&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly gave a little scream, and seemed in danger of falling
into a swoon of bliss.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a darling you
are!&rdquo; she languidly exclaimed, leaning back in her
chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and be hugged, or I must come and hug
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This resplendent programme was carried into execution with the
utmost rigour of the law.&nbsp; It being essential to make the
purchase of the doll its first feature&mdash;or that lady would
have lost the ponies&mdash;the toy-shop expedition took
precedence.&nbsp; Polly in the magic warehouse, with a doll as
large as herself under each arm, and a neat assortment of some
twenty more on view upon the counter, did indeed present a
spectacle of indecision not quite compatible with unalloyed
happiness, but the light cloud passed.&nbsp; The lovely specimen
oftenest chosen, oftenest rejected, and finally abided by, was of
Circassian descent, possessing <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>as much
boldness of beauty as was reconcilable with extreme feebleness of
mouth, and combining a sky-blue silk pelisse with rose-coloured
satin trousers, and a black velvet hat: which this fair stranger
to our northern shores would seem to have founded on the
portraits of the late Duchess of Kent.&nbsp; The name this
distinguished foreigner brought with her from beneath the glowing
skies of a sunny clime was (on Polly&rsquo;s authority) Miss
Melluka, and the costly nature of her outfit as a housekeeper,
from the Barbox coffers, may be inferred from the two facts that
her silver teaspoons were as large as her kitchen poker, and that
the proportions of her watch exceeded those of her
frying-pan.&nbsp; Miss Melluka was graciously pleased to express
her entire approbation of the Circus, and so was Polly; for the
ponies <i>were</i> speckled, and brought down nobody when they
fired, and the savagery of the wild beasts appeared to be mere
smoke&mdash;which article, in fact, they did produce in large
quantities from their insides.&nbsp; The Barbox absorption in the
general subject throughout the realisation of these delights was
again a sight to see, nor was it less worthy to behold at dinner,
when he drank to Miss Melluka, tied stiff in a chair opposite to
Polly (the fair Circassian possessing an unbendable spine), and
even induced the waiter to assist in carrying out with due
decorum the prevailing glorious idea.&nbsp; To wind up, there
came the <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>agreeable fever of getting Miss
Melluka and all her wardrobe and rich possessions into a fly with
Polly, to be taken home.&nbsp; But by that time Polly had become
unable to look upon such accumulated joys with waking eyes, and
had withdrawn her consciousness into the wonderful Paradise of a
child&rsquo;s sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sleep, Polly, sleep,&rdquo;
said Barbox Brothers, as her head dropped on his shoulder;
&ldquo;you shall not fall out of this bed, easily, at any
rate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What rustling piece of paper he took from his pocket, and
carefully folded into the bosom of Polly&rsquo;s frock, shall not
be mentioned.&nbsp; He said nothing about it, and nothing shall
be said about it.&nbsp; They drove to a modest suburb of the
great ingenious town, and stopped at the forecourt of a small
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not wake the child,&rdquo; said Barbox
Brothers, softly, to the driver, &ldquo;I will carry her in as
she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greeting the light at the opened door which was held by
Polly&rsquo;s mother, Polly&rsquo;s bearer passed on with mother
and child into a ground-floor room.&nbsp; There, stretched on a
sofa, lay a sick man, sorely wasted, who covered his eyes with
his emaciated hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tresham,&rdquo; said Barbox, in a kindly voice,
&ldquo;I have brought you back your Polly, fast asleep.&nbsp;
Give me your hand, and tell me you are better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man reached forth his right hand, and bowed his head
over the hand into which <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>it was taken
and kissed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, thank you!&nbsp; I may say
that I am well and happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s brave,&rdquo; said Barbox.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tresham, I have a fancy&mdash;can you make room for me
beside you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down on the sofa as he said words, cherishing the plump
peachy cheek that lay uppermost on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a fancy, Tresham (I am getting quite an old
fellow now, you know, and old fellows may take fancies into their
heads sometimes), to give up Polly, having found her, to no one
but you.&nbsp; Will you take her from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the father held out his arms for the child, each of the two
men looked steadily at the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very dear to you, Tresham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unutterably dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless her!&nbsp; It is not much, Polly,&rdquo; he
continued, turning his eyes upon her peaceful face as he
apostrophised her, &ldquo;it is not much, Polly, for a blind and
sinful man to invoke a blessing on something so far better than
himself as a little child is; but it would be much&mdash;much
upon his cruel head, and much upon his guilty soul&mdash;if he
could be so wicked as to invoke a curse.&nbsp; He had better have
a millstone round his neck, and be cast into the deepest
sea.&nbsp; Live and thrive, my pretty baby!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he
kissed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Live <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>and prosper,
and become in time the mother of other little children, like the
Angels who behold The Father&rsquo;s face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her again, gave her up gently to both her parents,
and went out.</p>
<p>But he went not to Wales.&nbsp; No, he never went to
Wales.&nbsp; He went straightway for another stroll about the
town, and he looked in upon the people at their work, and at
their play, here, there, everywhere, and where not.&nbsp; For he
was Barbox Brothers and Co. now, and had taken thousands of
partners into the solitary firm.</p>
<p>He had at length got back to his hotel room, and was standing
before his fire refreshing himself with a glass of hot drink
which he had stood upon the chimney-piece, when he heard the town
clocks striking, and, referring to his watch, found the evening
to have so slipped away, that they were striking twelve.&nbsp; As
he put up his watch again, his eyes met those of his reflection
in the chimney-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s your birthday already,&rdquo; he said,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are looking very well.&nbsp; I wish you
many happy returns of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had never before bestowed that wish upon himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By Jupiter!&rdquo; he discovered, &ldquo;it alters the
whole case of running away from one&rsquo;s birthday!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a thing to explain to Ph&oelig;be.&nbsp; Besides, here
is quite a long story to tell her, that has sprung out of the
road <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>with no story.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go back, instead of
going on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go back by my friend Lamps&rsquo;s Up
X presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to Mugby Junction, and in point of fact he
established himself at Mugby Junction.&nbsp; It was the
convenient place to live in, for brightening Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; It was the convenient place to live in, for having
her taught music by Beatrice.&nbsp; It was the convenient place
to live in, for occasionally borrowing Polly.&nbsp; It was the
convenient place to live in, for being joined at will to all
sorts of agreeable places and persons.&nbsp; So, he became
settled there, and, his house standing in an elevated situation,
it is noteworthy of him in conclusion, as Polly herself might
(not irreverently) have put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was an Old Barbox who lived on a hill,<br />
And if he ain&rsquo;t gone, he lives there still.</p>

<h2>MAIN LINE<br />
THE BOY AT MUGBY</h2>
<p>I am The Boy at Mugby.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s about what <i>I</i>
am.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what I mean?&nbsp; What a pity!&nbsp; But
I think you do.&nbsp; I think you must.&nbsp; Look here.&nbsp; I
am the Boy at what is called The Refreshment Room at Mugby
Junction, and what&rsquo;s proudest boast is, that it never yet
refreshed a mortal being.</p>
<p>Up in a corner of the Down Refreshment Room at Mugby Junction,
in the height of twenty-seven cross draughts (I&rsquo;ve often
counted &rsquo;em while they brush the First Class hair
twenty-seven ways), behind the bottles, among the glasses,
bounded on the nor&rsquo;-west by the <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>beer, stood
pretty far to the right of a metallic object that&rsquo;s at
times the tea-urn and at times the soup-tureen, according to the
nature of the last twang imparted to its contents which are the
same groundwork, fended off from the traveller by a barrier of
stale sponge-cakes erected atop of the counter, and lastly
exposed sideways to the glare of our Missis&rsquo;s eye&mdash;you
ask a Boy so sitiwated, next time you stop in a hurry at Mugby,
for anything to drink; you take particular notice that
he&rsquo;ll try to seem not to hear you, that he&rsquo;ll appear
in a absent manner to survey the Line through a transparent
medium composed of your head and body, and that he won&rsquo;t
serve you as long as you can possibly bear it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
Me.</p>
<p>What a lark it is!&nbsp; We are the Model Establishment, we
are, at Mugby.&nbsp; Other Refreshment Rooms send their imperfect
young ladies up to be finished off by our Missis.&nbsp; For some
of the young ladies, when they&rsquo;re new to the business, come
into it mild!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Our Missis, she soon takes that out
of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Why, I originally come into the business meek
myself.&nbsp; But Our Missis she soon took that out of
<i>me</i>.</p>
<p>What a delightful lark it is!&nbsp; I look upon us
Refreshmenters as ockipying the only proudly independent footing
on the Line.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Papers for instance&mdash;my
honourable friend if he will allow me to call him so&mdash;him as
belongs to Smith&rsquo;s bookstall.&nbsp; Why he no more <!--
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>dares to be up to our Refreshmenting games, than he
dares to jump atop of a locomotive with her steam at full
pressure, and cut away upon her alone, driving himself, at
limited-mail speed.&nbsp; Papers, he&rsquo;d get his head punched
at every compartment, first, second and third, the whole length
of a train, if he was to ventur to imitate my demeanour.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the same with the porters, the same with the guards,
the same with the ticket clerks, the same the whole way up to the
secretary, traffic manager, or very chairman.&nbsp; There
ain&rsquo;t a one among &rsquo;em on the nobly independent
footing we are.&nbsp; Did you ever catch one of <i>them</i>, when
you wanted anything of him, making a system of surveying the Line
through a transparent medium composed of your head and
body?&nbsp; I should hope not.</p>
<p>You should see our Bandolining Room at Mugby Junction.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s led to, by the door behind the counter which
you&rsquo;ll notice usually stands ajar, and it&rsquo;s the room
where Our Missis and our young ladies Bandolines their
hair.&nbsp; You should see &rsquo;em at it, betwixt trains,
Bandolining away, as if they was anointing themselves for the
combat.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re telegraphed, you should see their
noses all a going up with scorn, as if it was a part of the
working of the same Cooke and Wheatstone electrical
machinery.&nbsp; You should hear Our Missis give the word
&ldquo;Here comes the Beast to be Fed!&rdquo; <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>and then you
should see &rsquo;em indignantly skipping across the Line, from
the Up to the Down, or Wicer Warsaw, and begin to pitch the stale
pastry into the plates, and chuck the sawdust sangwiches under
the glass covers, and get out the&mdash;ha ha ha!&mdash;the
Sherry&mdash;O my eye, my eye!&mdash;for your Refreshment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only in the Isle of the Brave and Land of the Free
(by which of course I mean to say Britannia) that Refreshmenting
is so effective, so &rsquo;olesome, so constitutional, a check
upon the public.&nbsp; There was a foreigner, which having
politely, with his hat off, beseeched our young ladies and Our
Missis for &ldquo;a leetel gloss hoff prarndee,&rdquo; and having
had the Line surveyed through him by all and no other
acknowledgment, was a proceeding at last to help himself, as
seems to be the custom in his own country, when Our Missis with
her hair almost a coming un-Bandolined with rage, and her eyes
omitting sparks, flew at him, cotched the decanter out of his
hand, and said: &ldquo;Put it down!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t allow
that!&rdquo;&nbsp; The foreigner turned pale, stepped back with
his arms stretched out in front of him, his hands clasped, and
his shoulders riz, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Is it possible
this!&nbsp; That these disdaineous females and this ferocious old
woman are placed here by the administration, not only to empoison
the voyagers, but to affront them!&nbsp; Great Heaven!&nbsp; How
arrives it?&nbsp; The English <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>people.&nbsp;
Or is he then a slave?&nbsp; Or idiot?&rdquo;&nbsp; Another time,
a merry wideawake American gent had tried the sawdust and spit it
out, and had tried the Sherry and spit that out, and had tried in
vain to sustain exhausted natur upon Butter-Scotch, and had been
rather extra Bandolined and Line-surveyed through, when, as the
bell was ringing and he paid Our Missis, he says, very loud and
good-tempered: &ldquo;I tell Yew what &rsquo;tis,
ma&rsquo;arm.&nbsp; I la&rsquo;af.&nbsp; Theer!&nbsp; I
la&rsquo;af.&nbsp; I Dew.&nbsp; I oughter ha&rsquo; seen most
things, for I hail from the Onlimited side of the Atlantic Ocean,
and I haive travelled right slick over the Limited, head on
through Jee-rusalemm and the East, and likeways France and Italy,
Europe Old World, and am now upon the track to the Chief Europian
Village; but such an Institution as Yew, and Yewer young ladies,
and Yewer fixin&rsquo;s solid and liquid, afore the glorious
Tarnal I never did see yet!&nbsp; And if I hain&rsquo;t found the
eighth wonder of monarchical Creation, in finding Yew, and Yewer
young ladies, and Yewer fixin&rsquo;s solid and liquid, all as
aforesaid, established in a country where the people air not
absolute Loo-naticks, I am Extra Double Darned with a Nip and
Frizzle to the innermostest grit!&nbsp;
Wheerfur&mdash;Theer!&mdash;I la&rsquo;af!&nbsp; I Dew,
ma&rsquo;arm.&nbsp; I la&rsquo;af!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he went,
stamping and shaking his sides, along the platform all the way to
his own compartment.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>I think it was her standing up agin the Foreigner, as
giv&rsquo; Our Missis the idea of going over to France, and
droring a comparison betwixt Refreshmenting as followed among the
frog-eaters, and Refreshmenting as triumphant in the Isle of the
Brave and Land of the Free (by which of course I mean to say
agin, Britannia).&nbsp; Our young ladies, Miss Whiff, Miss Piff,
and Mrs. Sniff, was unanimous opposed to her going; for, as they
says to Our Missis one and all, it is well beknown to the hends
of the herth as no other nation except Britain has a idea of
anythink, but above all of business.&nbsp; Why then should you
tire yourself to prove what is aready proved?&nbsp; Our Missis
however (being a teazer at all pints) stood out grim obstinate,
and got a return pass by South-Eastern Tidal, to go right
through, if such should be her dispositions, to Marseilles.</p>
<p>Sniff is husband to Mrs. Sniff, and is a regular insignificant
cove.&nbsp; He looks arter the sawdust department in a back room,
and is sometimes when we are very hard put to it let in behind
the counter with a corkscrew; but never when it can be helped,
his demeanour towards the public being disgusting servile.&nbsp;
How Mrs. Sniff ever come so far to lower herself as to marry him,
I don&rsquo;t know; but I suppose <i>he</i> does, and I should
think he wished he didn&rsquo;t, for he leads a awful life.&nbsp;
Mrs. Sniff couldn&rsquo;t be much harder with him if he was
public.&nbsp; Similarly, <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Miss Whiff
and Miss Piff; taking the tone of Mrs. Sniff, they shoulder Sniff
about when he is let in with a corkscrew, and they whisk things
out of his hands when in his servility he is a going to let the
public have &rsquo;em, and they snap him up when in the crawling
baseness of his spirit he is a going to answer a public question,
and they drore more tears into his eyes than ever the mustard
does which he all day long lays on to the sawdust.&nbsp; (But it
ain&rsquo;t strong.)&nbsp; Once, when Sniff had the repulsiveness
to reach across to get the milk-pot to hand over for a baby, I
see Our Missis in her rage catch him by both his shoulders and
spin him out into the Bandolining Room.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Sniff.&nbsp; How different!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the
one!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the one as you&rsquo;ll notice to be
always looking another way from you, when you look at her.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s the one with the small waist buckled in tight in
front, and with the lace cuffs at her wrists, which she puts on
the edge of the counter before her, and stands a smoothing while
the public foams.&nbsp; This smoothing the cuffs and looking
another way while the public foams, is the last accomplishment
taught to the young ladies as come to Mugby to be finished by Our
Missis; and it&rsquo;s always taught by Mrs. Sniff.</p>
<p>When Our Missis went away upon her journey, Mrs. Sniff was
left in charge.&nbsp; She did hold the public in check most
beautiful!&nbsp; <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>In all my time, I never see half so
many cups of tea given without milk to people as wanted it with,
nor half so many cups of tea with milk given to people as wanted
it without.&nbsp; When foaming ensued, Mrs. Sniff would say:
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better settle it among yourselves, and
change with one another.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a most highly
delicious lark.&nbsp; I enjoyed the Refreshmenting business more
than ever, and was so glad I had took to it when young.</p>
<p>Our Missis returned.&nbsp; It got circulated among the young
ladies, and it as it might be penetrated to me through the
crevices of the Bandolining Room, that she had Orrors to reveal,
if revelations so contemptible could be dignified with the
name.&nbsp; Agitation become awakened.&nbsp; Excitement was up in
the stirrups.&nbsp; Expectation stood a tiptoe.&nbsp; At length
it was put forth that on our slackest evening in the week, and at
our slackest time of that evening betwixt trains, Our Missis
would give her views of foreign Refreshmenting, in the
Bandolining Room.</p>
<p>It was arranged tasteful for the purpose.&nbsp; The
Bandolining table and glass was hid in a corner, a arm-chair was
elevated on a packing-case for Our Missis&rsquo;s ockypation, a
table and a tumbler of water (no sherry in it, thankee) was
placed beside it.&nbsp; Two of the pupils, the season being
autumn, and hollyhocks and daliahs being <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>in,
ornamented the wall with three devices in those flowers.&nbsp; On
one might be read, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">May Albion never
Learn</span>;&rdquo; on another, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Keep
the Public Down</span>;&rdquo; on another, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Our Refreshmenting Charter</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
whole had a beautiful appearance, with which the beauty of the
sentiments corresponded.</p>
<p>On Our Missis&rsquo;s brow was wrote Severity, as she ascended
the fatal platform.&nbsp; (Not that that was anythink new.)&nbsp;
Miss Whiff and Miss Piff sat at her feet.&nbsp; Three chairs from
the Waiting Room might have been perceived by a average eye, in
front of her, on which the pupils was accommodated.&nbsp; Behind
them, a very close observer might have discerned a Boy.&nbsp;
Myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said Our Missis, glancing gloomily
around, &ldquo;is Sniff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it better,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Sniff,
&ldquo;that he should not be let to come in.&nbsp; He is such an
Ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; assented Our Missis.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
for that reason is it not desirable to improve his
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; Nothing will ever improve <i>him</i>,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Sniff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; pursued Our Missis, &ldquo;call him in,
Ezekiel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I called him in.&nbsp; The appearance of the low-minded cove
was hailed with disapprobation <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>from all
sides, on account of his having brought his corkscrew with
him.&nbsp; He pleaded &ldquo;the force of habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The force!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sniff.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us have you talking about force, for
Gracious sake.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; Do stand still where you are,
with your back against the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is a smiling piece of vacancy, and he smiled in the mean
way in which he will even smile at the public if he gets a chance
(language can say no meaner of him), and he stood upright near
the door with the back of his head agin the wall, as if he was a
waiting for somebody to come and measure his heighth for the
Army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not enter, ladies,&rdquo; says Our Missis,
&ldquo;on the revolting disclosures I am about to make, if it was
not in the hope that they will cause you to be yet more
implacable in the exercise of the power you wield in a
constitutional country, and yet more devoted to the
constitutional motto which I see before me;&rdquo; it was behind
her, but the words sounded better so; &ldquo;&lsquo;May Albion
never learn!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the pupils as had made the motto, admired it, and cried,
&ldquo;Hear!&nbsp; Hear!&nbsp; Hear!&rdquo;&nbsp; Sniff, showing
an inclination to join in chorus, got himself frowned down by
every brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The baseness of the French,&rdquo; pursued Our Missis,
&ldquo;as displayed in the fawning nature of their
Refreshmenting, equals, if not surpasses, <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>anythink as
was ever heard of the baseness of the celebrated
Buonaparte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Whiff, Miss Piff and me, we drored a heavy breath, equal
to saying, &ldquo;We thought as much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Whiff and Miss Piff seeming to object to my droring mine
along with theirs, I drored another, to aggravate &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I be believed,&rdquo; says Our Missis, with
flashing eyes, &ldquo;when I tell you that no sooner had I set my
foot upon that treacherous shore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Sniff, either busting out mad, or thinking aloud, says,
in a low voice: &ldquo;Feet.&nbsp; Plural, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowering that come upon him when he was spurned by all
eyes, added to his being beneath contempt, was sufficient
punishment for a cove so grovelling.&nbsp; In the midst of a
silence rendered more impressive by the turned-up female noses
with which it was pervaded, Our Missis went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I be believed when I tell you that no sooner had
I landed,&rdquo; this word with a killing look at Sniff,
&ldquo;on that treacherous shore, than I was ushered into a
Refreshment Room where there were, I do not exaggerate, actually
eatable things to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan burst from the ladies.&nbsp; I not only did myself the
honour of jining, but also of lengthening it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where there were,&rdquo; Our Missis added, <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;not only eatable things to eat, but also
drinkable things to drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur, swelling almost into a scream, ariz.&nbsp; Miss
Piff, trembling with indignation, called out:
&ldquo;Name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>will</i> name,&rdquo; said Our Missis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was roast fowls, hot and cold; there was smoking
roast veal surrounded with browned potatoes; there was hot soup
with (again I ask shall I be credited?) nothing bitter in it, and
no flour to choke off the consumer; there was a variety of cold
dishes set off with jelly; there was salad; there was&mdash;mark
me!&mdash;<i>fresh</i> pastry, and that of a light construction;
there was a luscious show of fruit.&nbsp; There was bottles and
decanters of sound small wine, of every size and adapted to every
pocket; the same odious statement will apply to brandy; and these
were set out upon the counter so that all could help
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our Missis&rsquo;s lips so quivered, that Mrs. Sniff, though
scarcely less convulsed than she were, got up and held the
tumbler to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; proceeds Our Missis, &ldquo;was my first
unconstitutional experience.&nbsp; Well would it have been, if it
had been my last and worst.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; As I proceeded
further into that enslaved and ignorant land, its aspect became
more hideous.&nbsp; I need not explain to this assembly, the
ingredients and formation of the British Refreshment
sangwich?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>Universal laughter&mdash;except from Sniff, who, as
sangwich-cutter, shook his head in a state of the utmost
dejection as he stood with it agin the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Our Missis, with dilated
nostrils.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take a fresh crisp long crusty penny loaf
made of the whitest and best flower.&nbsp; Cut it longwise
through the middle.&nbsp; Insert a fair and nicely fitting slice
of ham.&nbsp; Tie a smart piece of ribbon round the middle of the
whole to bind it together.&nbsp; Add at one end a neat wrapper of
clean white paper by which to hold it.&nbsp; And the universal
French Refreshment sangwich busts on your disgusted
vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cry of &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; from all&mdash;except Sniff,
which rubbed his stomach with a soothing hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not,&rdquo; said Our Missis, &ldquo;explain to
this assembly, the usual formation and fitting of the British
Refreshment Room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, no, and laughter.&nbsp; Sniff agin shaking his head in low
spirits agin the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Our Missis, &ldquo;what would you say
to a general decoration of everythink, to hangings (sometimes
elegant), to easy velvet furniture, to abundance of little
tables, to abundance of little seats, to brisk bright waiters, to
great convenience, to a pervading cleanliness and tastefulness
positively addressing the public and making the Beast thinking
itself worth the pains?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Contemptuous fury on the part of all the ladies.&nbsp;
Mrs. Sniff looking as if she wanted somebody to hold her, and
everybody else looking as if they&rsquo;d rayther not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times,&rdquo; said our Missis, working herself
into a truly terrimenjious state, &ldquo;three times did I see
these shamful things, only between the coast and Paris, and not
counting either: at Hazebroucke, at Arras, at Amiens.&nbsp; But
worse remains.&nbsp; Tell me, what would you call a person who
should propose in England that there should be kept, say at our
own model Mugby Junction, pretty baskets, each holding an
assorted cold lunch and dessert for one, each at a certain fixed
price, and each within a passenger&rsquo;s power to take away, to
empty in the carriage at perfect leisure, and to return at
another station fifty or a hundred miles further on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was disagreement what such a person should be
called.&nbsp; Whether revolutionist, atheist, Bright (<i>I</i>
said him), or Un-English.&nbsp; Miss Piff screeched her shrill
opinion last, in the words: &ldquo;A malignant maniac!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I adopt,&rdquo; says Our Missis, &ldquo;the brand set
upon such a person by the righteous indignation of my friend Miss
Piff.&nbsp; A malignant maniac.&nbsp; Know then, that that
malignant maniac has sprung from the congenial soil of France,
and that his malignant madness was in unchecked action on this
same part of my journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>I noticed that Sniff was a rubbing his hands, and that
Mrs. Sniff had got her eye upon him.&nbsp; But I did not take
more particular notice, owing to the excited state in which the
young ladies was, and to feeling myself called upon to keep it up
with a howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my experience south of Paris,&rdquo; said Our
Missis, in a deep tone, &ldquo;I will not expatiate.&nbsp; Too
loathsome were the task!&nbsp; But fancy this.&nbsp; Fancy a
guard coming round, with the train at full speed, to inquire how
many for dinner.&nbsp; Fancy his telegraphing forward, the number
of diners.&nbsp; Fancy every one expected, and the table
elegantly laid for the complete party.&nbsp; Fancy a charming
dinner, in a charming room, and the head-cook, concerned for the
honour of every dish, superintending in his clean white jacket
and cap.&nbsp; Fancy the Beast travelling six hundred miles on
end, very fast, and with great punctuality, yet being taught to
expect all this to be done for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spirited chorus of &ldquo;The Beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noticed that Sniff was agin a rubbing his stomach with a
soothing hand, and that he had drored up one leg.&nbsp; But agin
I didn&rsquo;t take particular notice, looking on myself as
called upon to stimilate public feeling.&nbsp; It being a lark
besides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting everything together,&rdquo; said Our Missis,
&ldquo;French Refreshmenting comes to this, and O it comes to a
nice total!&nbsp; First: <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>eatable
things to eat, and drinkable things to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan from the young ladies, kep&rsquo; up by me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second: convenience, and even elegance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another groan from the young ladies, kep&rsquo; up by me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third: moderate charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, a groan from me, kep&rsquo; up by the young
ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourth:&mdash;and here,&rdquo; says Our Missis,
&ldquo;I claim your angriest sympathy&mdash;attention, common
civility, nay, even politeness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me and the young ladies regularly raging mad all together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I cannot in conclusion,&rdquo; says Our Missis,
with her spitefullest sneer, &ldquo;give you a completer pictur
of that despicable nation (after what I have related), than
assuring you that they wouldn&rsquo;t bear our constitutional
ways and noble independence at Mugby Junction, for a single
month, and that they would turn us to the right-about and put
another system in our places, as soon as look at us; perhaps
sooner, for I do not believe they have the good taste to care to
look at us twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swelling tumult was arrested in its rise.&nbsp; Sniff,
bore away by his servile disposition, had drored up his leg with
a higher and a higher relish, and was now discovered to be waving
his corkscrew over his head.&nbsp; It was at this <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>moment that Mrs. Sniff, who had kep&rsquo; her eye upon
him like the fabled obelisk, descended on her victim.&nbsp; Our
Missis followed them both out, and cries was heard in the sawdust
department.</p>
<p>You come into the Down Refreshment Room, at the Junction,
making believe you don&rsquo;t know me, and I&rsquo;ll pint you
out with my right thumb over my shoulder which is Our Missis, and
which is Miss Whiff; and which is Miss Piff; and which is Mrs.
Sniff.&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t get a chance to see Sniff,
because he disappeared that night.&nbsp; Whether he perished,
tore to pieces, I cannot say; but his corkscrew alone remains, to
bear witness to the servility of his disposition.</p>

THE SIGNAL-MAN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa!&nbsp; Below there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at
the door of his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its
short pole.&nbsp; One would have thought, considering the nature
of the ground, that he could not have doubted from what quarter
the voice came; but, instead of looking up to where I stood on
the top of the steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned
himself about and looked down the Line.&nbsp; There was something
remarkable in his manner of doing so, though I could not have
said, for my life, what.&nbsp; But, I know it was remarkable
enough to attract my notice, even though his figure was
foreshortened and shadowed, down in the deep trench, and mine was
high above him, so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset that I
had shaded my eyes with my hand before I saw him at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa!&nbsp; Below!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>From looking down the Line, he turned himself about
again, and, raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any path by which I can come down and speak to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at me without replying, and I looked down at him
without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle
question.&nbsp; Just then, there came a vague vibration in the
earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an
oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had
force to draw me down.&nbsp; When such vapour as rose to my
height from this rapid train, had passed me and was skimming away
over the landscape, I looked down again and saw him re-furling
the flag he had shown while the train went by.</p>
<p>I repeated my inquiry.&nbsp; After a pause, during which he
seemed to regard me with fixed attention, he motioned with his
rolled-up flag towards a point on my level, some two or three
hundred yards distant.&nbsp; I called down to him, &ldquo;All
right!&rdquo; and made for that point.&nbsp; There, by dint of
looking closely about me, I found a rough zig-zag descending path
notched out: which I followed.</p>
<p>The cutting was extremely deep, and unusually
precipitate.&nbsp; It was made through a clammy stone that became
oozier and wetter as I went down.&nbsp; For these reasons, I
found the way long enough to give me time to recall <!-- page
91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>a
singular air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had
pointed out the path.</p>
<p>When I came down low enough upon the zig-zag descent, to see
him again, I saw that he was standing between the rails on the
way by which the train had lately passed, in an attitude as if he
were waiting for me to appear.&nbsp; He had his left hand at his
chin, and that left elbow rested on his right hand crossed over
his breast.&nbsp; His attitude was one of such expectation and
watchfulness, that I stopped a moment, wondering at it.</p>
<p>I resumed my downward way, and, stepping out upon the level of
the railroad and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark
sallow man, with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows.&nbsp;
His post was in as solitary and dismal a place as ever I
saw.&nbsp; On either side, a dripping-wet wall of jagged stone,
excluding all view but a strip of sky; the perspective one way,
only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon; the shorter
perspective in the other direction, terminating in a gloomy red
light, and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel, in whose
massive architecture there was a barbarous, depressing, and
forbidding air.&nbsp; So little sunlight ever found its way to
this spot, that it had an earthy deadly smell; and so much cold
wind rushed through it, that it struck chill to me, as if I had
left the natural world.</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Before he stirred, I was near enough to him to have
touched him.&nbsp; Not even then removing his eyes from mine, he
stepped back one step, and lifted his hand.</p>
<p>This was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had
riveted my attention when I looked down from up yonder.&nbsp; A
visitor was a rarity, I should suppose; not an unwelcome rarity,
I hoped?&nbsp; In me, he merely saw a man who had been shut up
within narrow limits all his life, and who, being at last set
free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great works.&nbsp;
To such purpose I spoke to him; but I am far from sure of the
terms I used, for, besides that I am not happy in opening any
conversation, there was something in the man that daunted me.</p>
<p>He directed a most curious look towards the red light near the
tunnel&rsquo;s mouth, and looked all about it, as if something
were missing from it, and then looked at me.</p>
<p>That light was part of his charge?&nbsp; Was it not?</p>
<p>He answered in a low voice: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monstrous thought came into my mind as I perused the fixed
eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a
man.&nbsp; I have speculated since, whether there may have been
infection in his mind.</p>
<p>In my turn, I stepped back.&nbsp; But in making <!-- page
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the
action, I detected in his eyes some latent fear of me.&nbsp; This
put the monstrous thought to flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look at me,&rdquo; I said, forcing a smile,
&ldquo;as if you had a dread of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was doubtful,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;whether I
had seen you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the red light he had looked at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Intently watchful of me, he replied (but without sound),
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good fellow, what should I do there?&nbsp; However,
be that as it may, I never was there, you may swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I may,&rdquo; he rejoined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I am sure I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner cleared, like my own.&nbsp; He replied to my
remarks with readiness, and in well-chosen words.&nbsp; Had he
much to do there?&nbsp; Yes; that was to say, he had enough
responsibility to bear; but exactness and watchfulness were what
was required of him, and of actual work&mdash;manual
labour&mdash;he had next to none.&nbsp; To change that signal, to
trim those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and then, was
all he had to do under that head.&nbsp; Regarding those many long
and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much, he could only
say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that
form, and he had grown used to it.&nbsp; He had <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>taught
himself a language down here&mdash;if only to know it by sight,
and to have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation,
could be called learning it.&nbsp; He had also worked at
fractions and decimals, and tried a little algebra; but he was,
and had been as a boy, a poor hand at figures.&nbsp; Was it
necessary for him when on duty, always to remain in that channel
of damp air, and could he never rise into the sunshine from
between those high stone walls?&nbsp; Why, that depended upon
times and circumstances.&nbsp; Under some conditions there would
be less upon the Line than under others, and the same held good
as to certain hours of the day and night.&nbsp; In bright
weather, he did choose occasions for getting a little above these
lower shadows; but, being at all times liable to be called by his
electric bell, and at such times listening for it with redoubled
anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.</p>
<p>He took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk for an
official book in which he had to make certain entries, a
telegraphic instrument with its dial face and needles, and the
little bell of which he had spoken.&nbsp; On my trusting that he
would excuse the remark that he had been well educated, and (I
hoped I might say without offence), perhaps educated above that
station, he observed that instances of slight incongruity in
such-wise would rarely be found wanting among large bodies of
men; <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>that he had heard it was so in workhouses, in the police
force, even in that last desperate resource, the army; and that
he knew it was so, more or less, in any great railway
staff.&nbsp; He had been, when young (if I could believe it,
sitting in that hut; he scarcely could), a student of natural
philosophy, and had attended lectures; but he had run wild,
misused his opportunities, gone down, and never risen
again.&nbsp; He had no complaint to offer about that.&nbsp; He
had made his bed, and he lay upon it.&nbsp; It was far too late
to make another.</p>
<p>All that I have here condensed, he said in a quiet manner,
with his grave dark regards divided between me and the
fire.&nbsp; He threw in the word &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; from time to
time, and especially when he referred to his youth: as though to
request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what I
found him.&nbsp; He was several times interrupted by the little
bell, and had to read off messages, and send replies.&nbsp; Once,
he had to stand without the door, and display a flag as a train
passed, and make some verbal communication to the driver.&nbsp;
In the discharge of his duties I observed him to be remarkably
exact and vigilant, breaking off his discourse at a syllable, and
remaining silent until what he had to do was done.</p>
<p>In a word, I should have set this man down as one of the
safest of men to be employed in that capacity, but for the
circumstance that <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>while he was speaking to me he twice
broke off with a fallen colour, turned his face towards the
little bell when it did <span class="smcap">not</span> ring,
opened the door of the hut (which was kept shut to exclude the
unhealthy damp), and looked out towards the red light near the
mouth of the tunnel.&nbsp; On both of those occasions, he came
back to the fire with the inexplicable air upon him which I had
remarked, without being able to define, when we were so far
asunder.</p>
<p>Said I when I rose to leave him: &ldquo;You almost make me
think that I have met with a contented man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(I am afraid I must acknowledge that I said it to lead him
on).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I used to be so,&rdquo; he rejoined, in the
low voice in which he had first spoken; &ldquo;but I am troubled,
sir, I am troubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have recalled the words if he could.&nbsp; He had
said them, however, and I took them up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what?&nbsp; What is your trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very difficult to impart, sir.&nbsp; It is very,
very, difficult to speak of.&nbsp; If ever you make me another
visit, I will try to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I expressly intend to make you another visit.&nbsp;
Say, when shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go off early in the morning, and I shall be on again
at ten to-morrow night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come at eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thanked me, and went out at the door <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>with
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show my white light, sir,&rdquo; he
said, in his peculiar low voice, &ldquo;till you have found the
way up.&nbsp; When you have found it, don&rsquo;t call out!&nbsp;
And when you are at the top, don&rsquo;t call out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner seemed to make the place strike colder to me, but I
said no more than &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you come down to-morrow night, don&rsquo;t
call out!&nbsp; Let me ask you a parting question.&nbsp; What
made you cry &lsquo;Halloa!&nbsp; Below there!&rsquo;
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cried
something to that effect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to that effect, sir.&nbsp; Those were the very
words.&nbsp; I know them well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admit those were the very words.&nbsp; I said them, no
doubt, because I saw you below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For no other reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other reason could I possibly have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no feeling that they were conveyed to you in
any supernatural way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wished me good night, and held up his light.&nbsp; I walked
by the side of the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable
sensation of a train coming behind me), until I found the
path.&nbsp; It was easier to mount than to descend, and I got
back to my inn without any adventure.</p>
<p>Punctual to my appointment, I placed my <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>foot on the
first notch of the zig-zag next night, as the distant clocks were
striking eleven.&nbsp; He was waiting for me at the bottom, with
his white light on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not called out,&rdquo; I
said, when we came close together; &ldquo;may I speak
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By all means, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good night then, and here&rsquo;s my hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good night, sir, and here&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
that, we walked side by side to his box, entered it, closed the
door, and sat down by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made up my mind, sir,&rdquo; he began, bending
forward as soon as we were seated, and speaking in a tone but a
little above a whisper, &ldquo;that you shall not have to ask me
twice what troubles me.&nbsp; I took you for some one else
yesterday evening.&nbsp; That troubles me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; That some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I never saw the face.&nbsp;
The left arm is across the face, and the right arm is
waved.&nbsp; Violently waved.&nbsp; This way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action of
an arm gesticulating with the utmost passion and vehemence:
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake clear the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moonlight night,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I was
sitting here, when I heard a voice cry <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&lsquo;Halloa!&nbsp; Below there!&rsquo; I started up,
looked from that door, and saw this Some one else standing by the
red light near the tunnel, waving as I just now showed you.&nbsp;
The voice seemed hoarse with shouting, and it cried, &lsquo;Look
out!&nbsp; Look out!&rsquo; And then again &lsquo;Halloa!&nbsp;
Below there!&nbsp; Look out!&rsquo; I caught up my lamp, turned
it on red, and ran towards the figure, calling,
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&nbsp; What has happened?&nbsp;
Where?&rsquo;&nbsp; It stood just outside the blackness of the
tunnel.&nbsp; I advanced so close upon it that I wondered at its
keeping the sleeve across its eyes.&nbsp; I ran right up at it,
and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away, when it
was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the tunnel,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I ran on, into the tunnel, five hundred
yards.&nbsp; I stopped and held my lamp above my head, and saw
the figures of the measured distance, and saw the wet stains
stealing down the walls and trickling through the arch.&nbsp; I
ran out again, faster than I had run in (for I had a mortal
abhorrence of the place upon me), and I looked all round the red
light with my own red light, and I went up the iron ladder to the
gallery atop of it, and I came down again, and ran back
here.&nbsp; I telegraphed both ways: &lsquo;An alarm has been
given.&nbsp; Is anything wrong?&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer came
back, both ways: &lsquo;All well.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>tracing out
my spine, I showed him how that this figure must be a deception
of his sense of sight, and how that figures, originating in
disease of the delicate nerves that minister to the functions of
the eye, were known to have often troubled patients, some of whom
had become conscious of the nature of their affliction, and had
even proved it by experiments upon themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to
an imaginary cry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do but listen for a
moment to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so
low, and to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph
wires!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all very well, he returned, after we had sat
listening for a while, and he ought to know something of the wind
and the wires, he who so often passed long winter nights there,
alone and watching.&nbsp; But he would beg to remark that he had
not finished.</p>
<p>I asked his pardon, and he slowly added these words, touching
my arm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within six hours after the Appearance, the memorable
accident on this Line happened, and within ten hours the dead and
wounded were brought along through the tunnel over the spot where
the figure had stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I did my best
against it.&nbsp; It was not to be denied, I rejoined, that this
was a remarkable coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his
mind.&nbsp; But, it was unquestionable that <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>remarkable
coincidences did continually occur, and they must be taken into
account in dealing with such a subject.&nbsp; Though to be sure I
must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that he was going to
bring the objection to bear upon me), men of common sense did not
allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations
of life.</p>
<p>He again begged to remark that he had not finished.</p>
<p>I again begged his pardon for being betrayed into
interruptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, again laying his hand upon my
arm, and glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes, &ldquo;was
just a year ago.&nbsp; Six or seven months passed, and I had
recovered from the surprise and shock, when one morning, as the
day was breaking, I, standing at that door, looked towards the
red light, and saw the spectre again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped,
with a fixed look at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it cry out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; It was silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it wave its arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; It leaned against the shaft of the light,
with both hands before the face.&nbsp; Like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, I followed his action with my eyes.&nbsp; It was an
action of mourning.&nbsp; I have seen such an attitude in stone
figures on tombs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go up to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;I came in and sat down, partly to collect my
thoughts, partly because it had turned me faint.&nbsp; When I
went to the door again, daylight was above me, and the ghost was
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But nothing followed?&nbsp; Nothing came of
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He touched me on the arm with his forefinger twice or thrice,
giving a ghastly nod each time:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I
noticed, at a carriage window on my side, what looked like a
confusion of hands and heads, and something waved.&nbsp; I saw
it, just in time to signal the driver, Stop!&nbsp; He shut off,
and put his brake on, but the train drifted past here a hundred
and fifty yards or more.&nbsp; I ran after it, and, as I went
along, heard terrible screams and cries.&nbsp; A beautiful young
lady had died instantaneously in one of the compartments, and was
brought in here, and laid down on this floor between
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily, I pushed my chair back, as I looked from the
boards at which he pointed, to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, sir.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; Precisely as it happened,
so I tell it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could think of nothing to say, to any purpose, and my mouth
was very dry.&nbsp; The wind and the wires took up the story with
a long lamenting wail.</p>
<p>He resumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, sir, mark this, and <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>judge how my mind is troubled.&nbsp; The spectre came
back, a week ago.&nbsp; Ever since, it has been there, now and
again, by fits and starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Danger-light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it seem to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated, if possible with increased passion and vehemence,
that former gesticulation of &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake clear
the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no peace or rest for
it.&nbsp; It calls to me, for many minutes together, in an
agonised manner, &lsquo;Below there!&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; Look
out!&rsquo;&nbsp; It stands waving to me.&nbsp; It rings my
little bell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught at that.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did it ring your bell yesterday
evening when I was here, and you went to the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how your imagination
misleads you.&nbsp; My eyes were on the bell, and my ears were
open to the bell, and if I am a living man, it did <span
class="smcap">not</span> ring at those times.&nbsp; No, nor at
any other time, except when it was rung in the natural course of
physical things by the station communicating with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never made a mistake as
to that, yet, sir.&nbsp; I have never confused the
spectre&rsquo;s ring with the man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
ghost&rsquo;s ring is a strange vibration in the bell that it
derives from nothing else, and I have not asserted that the bell
stirs to the eye.&nbsp; I <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>don&rsquo;t
wonder that you failed to hear it.&nbsp; But <i>I</i> heard
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did the spectre seem to be there, when you looked
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <span class="smcap">was</span> there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated firmly: &ldquo;Both times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come to the door with me, and look for it
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bit his under-lip as though he were somewhat unwilling, but
arose.&nbsp; I opened the door, and stood on the step, while he
stood in the doorway.&nbsp; There, was the Danger-light.&nbsp;
There, was the dismal mouth of the tunnel.&nbsp; There, were the
high wet stone walls of the cutting.&nbsp; There, were the stars
above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see it?&rdquo; I asked him, taking particular
note of his face.&nbsp; His eyes were prominent and strained; but
not very much more so, perhaps, than my own had been when I had
directed them earnestly towards the same spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>We went in again, shut the door, and resumed our seats.&nbsp;
I was thinking how best to improve this advantage, if it might be
called one, when he took up the conversation in such a matter of
course way, so assuming that there could be no serious question
of fact between <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>us, that I felt myself placed in the
weakest of positions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time you will fully understand, sir,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that what troubles me so dreadfully, is the
question, What does the spectre mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not sure, I told him, that I did fully understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is its warning against?&rdquo; he said,
ruminating, with his eyes on the fire, and only by times turning
them on me.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the danger?&nbsp; Where is the
danger?&nbsp; There is danger overhanging, somewhere on the
Line.&nbsp; Some dreadful calamity will happen.&nbsp; It is not
to be doubted this third time, after what has gone before.&nbsp;
But surely this is a cruel haunting of <i>me</i>.&nbsp; What can
<i>I</i> do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped the drops from his
heated forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on
both, I can give no reason for it,&rdquo; he went on, wiping the
palms of his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should get into trouble, and
do no good.&nbsp; They would think I was mad.&nbsp; This is the
way it would work:&mdash;Message: &lsquo;Danger!&nbsp; Take
care!&rsquo;&nbsp; Answer: &lsquo;What danger?&nbsp;
Where?&rsquo;&nbsp; Message: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But
for God&rsquo;s sake take care!&rsquo;&nbsp; They would displace
me.&nbsp; What else could they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pain of mind was most pitiable to see.&nbsp; It was the
mental torture of a conscientious <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>man,
oppressed beyond endurance by an unintelligible responsibility
involving life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it first stood under the Danger-light,&rdquo; he
went on, putting his dark hair back from his head, and drawing
his hands outward across and across his temples in an extremity
of feverish distress, &ldquo;why not tell me where that accident
was to happen&mdash;if it must happen?&nbsp; Why not tell me how
it could be averted&mdash;if it could have been averted?&nbsp;
When on its second coming it hid its face, why not tell me
instead: &lsquo;She is going to die.&nbsp; Let them keep her at
home&rsquo;?&nbsp; If it came, on those two occasions, only to
show me that its warnings were true, and so to prepare me for the
third, why not warn me plainly now?&nbsp; And I, Lord help
me!&nbsp; A mere poor signal-man on this solitary station!&nbsp;
Why not go to somebody with credit to be believed, and power to
act!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I saw him in this state, I saw that for the poor
man&rsquo;s sake, as well as for the public safety, what I had to
do for the time was, to compose his mind.&nbsp; Therefore,
setting aside all question of reality or unreality between us, I
represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty,
must do well, and that at least it was his comfort that he
understood his duty, though he did not understand these
confounding Appearances.&nbsp; In this effort I succeeded far
better than in the attempt to reason him out of his
conviction.&nbsp; <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>He became calm; the occupations
incidental to his post as the night advanced, began to make
larger demands on his attention; and I left him at two in the
morning.&nbsp; I had offered to stay through the night, but he
would not hear of it.</p>
<p>That I more than once looked back at the red light as I
ascended the pathway, that I did not like the red light, and that
I should have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it, I see
no reason to conceal.&nbsp; Nor, did I like the two sequences of
the accident and the dead girl.&nbsp; I see no reason to conceal
that, either.</p>
<p>But, what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how
ought I to act, having become the recipient of this
disclosure?&nbsp; I had proved the man to be intelligent,
vigilant, painstaking, and exact; but how long might he remain
so, in his state of mind?&nbsp; Though in a subordinate position,
still he held a most important trust, and would I (for instance)
like to stake my own life on the chances of his continuing to
execute it with precision?</p>
<p>Unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something
treacherous in my communicating what he had told me, to his
superiors in the Company, without first being plain with himself
and proposing a middle course to him, I ultimately resolved to
offer to accompany him (otherwise keeping his secret for the
present) to the wisest medical <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>practitioner we could hear of in those parts, and to
take his opinion.&nbsp; A change in his time of duty would come
round next night, he had apprised me, and he would be off an hour
or two after sunrise, and on again soon after sunset.&nbsp; I had
appointed to return accordingly.</p>
<p>Next evening was a lovely evening, and I walked out early to
enjoy it.&nbsp; The sun was not yet quite down when I traversed
the field-path near the top of the deep cutting.&nbsp; I would
extend my walk for an hour, I said to myself, half an hour on and
half an hour back, and it would then be time to go to my
signal-man&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p>Before pursuing my stroll, I stepped to the brink, and
mechanically looked down, from the point from which I had first
seen him.&nbsp; I cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me,
when, close at the mouth of the tunnel, I saw the appearance of a
man, with his left sleeve across his eyes, passionately waving
his right arm.</p>
<p>The nameless horror that oppressed me, passed in a moment, for
in a moment I saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed,
and that there was a little group of other men standing at a
short distance, to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he
made.&nbsp; The Danger-light was not yet lighted.&nbsp; Against
its shaft, a little low hut, entirely new to me, had been made of
some wooden <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>supports and tarpaulin.&nbsp; It
looked no bigger than a bed.</p>
<p>With an irresistible sense that something was wrong&mdash;with
a flashing self-reproachful fear that fatal mischief had come of
my leaving the man there, and causing no one to be sent to
overlook or correct what he did&mdash;I descended the notched
path with all the speed I could make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I asked the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signal-man killed this morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the man belonging to that box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the man I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will recognise him, sir, if you knew him,&rdquo;
said the man who spoke for the others, solemnly uncovering his
own head and raising an end of the tarpaulin, &ldquo;for his face
is quite composed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! how did this happen, how did this happen?&rdquo; I
asked, turning from one to another as the hut closed in
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was cut down by an engine, sir.&nbsp; No man in
England knew his work better.&nbsp; But somehow he was not clear
of the outer rail.&nbsp; It was just at broad day.&nbsp; He had
struck the light, and had the lamp in his hand.&nbsp; As the
engine came out of the tunnel, his back was towards her, and she
cut him down.&nbsp; That man drove her, and was showing how it
happened.&nbsp; Show the gentleman, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>The man, who wore a rough dark dress, stepped back to
his former place at the mouth of the tunnel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming round the curve in the tunnel, sir,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I saw him at the end, like as if I saw him down a
perspective-glass.&nbsp; There was no time to check speed, and I
knew him to be very careful.&nbsp; As he didn&rsquo;t seem to
take heed of the whistle, I shut it off when we were running down
upon him, and called to him as loud as I could call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, Below there!&nbsp; Look out!&nbsp; Look
out!&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake clear the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! it was a dreadful time, sir.&nbsp; I never left off
calling to him.&nbsp; I put this arm before my eyes, not to see,
and I waved this arm to the last; but it was no use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its
curious circumstances more than on any other, I may, in closing
it, point out the coincidence that the warning of the
Engine-Driver included, not only the words which the unfortunate
Signal-man had repeated to me as haunting him, but also the words
which I myself&mdash;not he&mdash;had attached, and that only in
my own mind, to the gesticulation he had imitated.</p>

BRANCH LINE<br />
THE ENGINE-DRIVER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether?&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Altogether, since 1841,
I&rsquo;ve killed seven men and boys.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t many
in all those years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These startling words he uttered in a serious tone as he
leaned against the Station-wall.&nbsp; He was a thick-set,
ruddy-faced man, with coal-black eyes, the whites of which were
not white, but a brownish-yellow, and apparently scarred and
seamed, as if they had been operated upon.&nbsp; They were eyes
that had worked hard in looking through wind and weather.&nbsp;
He was dressed in a short black pea-jacket and grimy white canvas
trousers, and wore on his head a flat black cap.&nbsp; There was
no sign of levity in his face.&nbsp; His look was serious even to
sadness, and there was an air of responsibility about his whole
bearing which assured me that he spoke in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have been for five-and-twenty years a
Locomotive Engine-driver; and in all <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>that time,
I&rsquo;ve only killed seven men and boys.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
not many of my mates as can say as much for themselves.&nbsp;
Steadiness, sir&mdash;steadiness and keeping your eyes open, is
what does it.&nbsp; When I say seven men and boys, I mean my
mates&mdash;stokers, porters, and so forth.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
count passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How did he become an engine-driver?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was a wheelwright in
a small way, and lived in a little cottage by the side of the
railway which runs betwixt Leeds and Selby.&nbsp; It was the
second railway laid down in the kingdom, the second after the
Liverpool and Manchester, where Mr. Huskisson was killed, as you
may have heard on, sir.&nbsp; When the trains rushed by, we young
&rsquo;uns used to run out to look at &rsquo;em, and
hooray.&nbsp; I noticed the driver turning handles, and making it
go, and I thought to myself it would be a fine thing to be a
engine-driver, and have the control of a wonderful machine like
that.&nbsp; Before the railway, the driver of the mail-coach was
the biggest man I knew.&nbsp; I thought I should like to be the
driver of a coach.&nbsp; We had a picture in our cottage of
George the Third in a red coat.&nbsp; I always mixed up the
driver of the mail-coach&mdash;who had a red coat, too&mdash;with
the king, only he had a low-crowned broad-brimmed hat, which the
king hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; In my idea, the king couldn&rsquo;t be a
greater man than the driver of the mail-coach.&nbsp; <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>I
had always a fancy to be a head man of some kind.&nbsp; When I
went to Leeds once, and saw a man conducting a orchestra, I
thought I should like to be the conductor of a orchestra.&nbsp;
When I went home I made myself a baton, and went about the fields
conducting a orchestra.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t there, of course,
but I pretended it was.&nbsp; At another time, a man with a whip
and a speaking-trumpet, on the stage outside a show, took my
fancy, and I thought I should like to be him.&nbsp; But when the
train came, the engine-driver put them all in the shade, and I
was resolved to be a engine-driver.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t long
before I had to do something to earn my own living, though I was
only a young &rsquo;un.&nbsp; My father died suddenly&mdash;he
was killed by thunder and lightning while standing under a tree
out of the rain&mdash;and mother couldn&rsquo;t keep us
all.&nbsp; The day after my father&rsquo;s burial I walked down
to the station, and said I wanted to be a engine-driver.&nbsp;
The station-master laughed a bit, said I was for beginning early,
but that I was not quite big enough yet.&nbsp; He gave me a
penny, and told me to go home and grow, and come again in ten
years&rsquo; time.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t dream of danger
then.&nbsp; If I couldn&rsquo;t be a engine-driver, I was
determined to have something to do about a engine; so, as I could
get nothing else, I went on board a Humber steamer, and broke up
coals for the stoker.&nbsp; That was how I <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>began.&nbsp; From that, I became a stoker, first on
board a boat, and then on a locomotive.&nbsp; Then, after two
years&rsquo; service, I became a driver on the very Line which
passed our cottage.&nbsp; My mother and my brothers and sisters
came out to look at me, the first day I drove.&nbsp; I was
watching for them and they was watching for me, and they waved
their hands and hoora&rsquo;d, and I waved my hand to them.&nbsp;
I had the steam well up, and was going at a rattling pace, and
rare proud I was that minute.&nbsp; Never was so proud in my
life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man has a liking for a thing it&rsquo;s as good
as being clever.&nbsp; In a very short time I became one of the
best drivers on the Line.&nbsp; That was allowed.&nbsp; I took a
pride in it, you see, and liked it.&nbsp; No, I didn&rsquo;t know
much about the engine scientifically, as you call it; but I could
put her to rights if anything went out of gear&mdash;that is to
say, if there was nothing broken&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t have
explained how the steam worked inside.&nbsp; Starting a engine,
it&rsquo;s just like drawing a drop of gin.&nbsp; You turn a
handle and off she goes; then you turn the handle the other way,
put on the brakes, and you stop her.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not much
more in it, so far.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no good being scientific and
knowing the principle of the engine inside; no good at all.&nbsp;
Fitters, who know all the ins and outs of the engine, make the
worst drivers.&nbsp; <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>That&rsquo;s well known.&nbsp; They
know too much.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just as I&rsquo;ve heard of a man
with regard to <i>his</i> inside: if he knew what a complicated
machine it is, he would never eat, or drink, or dance, or run, or
do anything, for fear of busting something.&nbsp; So it is with
fitters.&nbsp; But us as are not troubled with such thoughts, we
go ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But starting a engine&rsquo;s one thing and driving of
her is another.&nbsp; Any one, a child a&rsquo;most, can turn on
the steam and turn it off again; but it ain&rsquo;t every one
that can keep a engine well on the road, no more than it
ain&rsquo;t every one who can ride a horse properly.&nbsp; It is
much the same thing.&nbsp; If you gallop a horse right off for a
mile or two, you take the wind out of him, and for the next mile
or two you must let him trot or walk.&nbsp; So it is with a
engine.&nbsp; If you put on too much steam, to get over the
ground at the start, you exhaust the boiler, and then
you&rsquo;ll have to crawl along till your fresh water boils
up.&nbsp; The great thing in driving, is, to go steady, never to
let your water get too low, nor your fire too low.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the same with a kettle.&nbsp; If you fill it up when
it&rsquo;s about half empty, it soon comes to the boil again; but
if you don&rsquo;t fill it up until the water&rsquo;s nearly out,
it&rsquo;s a long time in coming to the boil again.&nbsp; Another
thing; you should never make spurts, unless you are detained and
lose time.&nbsp; You should <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>go up a
incline and down a incline at the same pace.&nbsp; Sometimes a
driver will waste his steam, and when he comes to a hill he has
scarcely enough to drag him up.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re in a
train that goes by fits and starts, you may be sure that there is
a bad driver on the engine.&nbsp; That kind of driving frightens
passengers dreadful.&nbsp; When the train, after rattling along,
suddenly slackens speed when it ain&rsquo;t near a station, it
may be in the middle of a tunnel, the passengers think there is
danger.&nbsp; But generally it&rsquo;s because the driver has
exhausted his steam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drove the Brighton express, four or five years before
I come here, and the annuals&mdash;that is, the passengers who
had annual tickets&mdash;always said they knew when I was on the
engine, because they wasn&rsquo;t jerked.&nbsp; Gentlemen used to
say as they came on to the platform, &lsquo;Who drives
to-day&mdash;Jim Martin?&rsquo;&nbsp; And when the guard told
them yes, they said &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; and took their seats
quite comfortable.&nbsp; But the driver never gets so much as a
shilling; the guard comes in for all that, and he does nothing
much.&nbsp; Few ever think of the driver.&nbsp; I dare say they
think the train goes along of itself; yet if we didn&rsquo;t keep
a sharp look-out, know our duty, and do it, they might all go
smash at any moment.&nbsp; I used to make that journey to
Brighton in fifty-two minutes.&nbsp; The papers said forty-nine
minutes, but that <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>was coming it a little too
strong.&nbsp; I had to watch signals all the way, one every two
miles, so that me and my stoker were on the stretch all the time,
doing two things at once&mdash;attending to the engine and
looking out.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve driven on this Line, eighty-one
miles and three-quarters, in eighty-six minutes.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no danger in speed if you have a good road, a good
engine, and not too many coaches behind.&nbsp; No, we don&rsquo;t
call them carriages, we call them &lsquo;coaches.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; oscillation means danger.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re
ever in a coach that oscillates much, tell of it at the first
station and get it coupled up closer.&nbsp; Coaches when
they&rsquo;re too loose are apt to jump, or swing off the rails;
and it&rsquo;s quite as dangerous when they&rsquo;re coupled up
too close.&nbsp; There ought to be just space enough for the
buffers to work easy.&nbsp; Passengers are frightened in tunnels,
but there&rsquo;s less danger, <i>now</i>, in tunnels than
anywhere else.&nbsp; We never enter a tunnel unless it&rsquo;s
signalled Clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A train can be stopped wonderful quick, even when
running express, if the guards act with the driver and clap on
all the brakes promptly.&nbsp; Much depends upon the
guards.&nbsp; One brake behind, is as good as two in front.&nbsp;
The engine, you see, loses weight as she burns her coals and
consumes her water, but the coaches behind don&rsquo;t
alter.&nbsp; We have a good deal of trouble with young
guards.&nbsp; In their <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>anxiety to
perform their duties, they put on the brakes too soon, so that
sometimes we can scarcely drag the train into the station; when
they grow older at it they are not so anxious, and don&rsquo;t
put them on soon enough.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use to say, when an
accident happens, that they did not put on the brakes in time;
they swear they did, and you can&rsquo;t prove that they
didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I think that the tapping of the wheels with a hammer
is a mere ceremony?&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly; I
should not like to say.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not often that the chaps
find anything wrong.&nbsp; They may sometimes be half asleep when
a train comes into a station in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
You would be yourself.&nbsp; They ought to tap the axle-box, but
they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many accidents take place that never get into the
papers; many trains, full of passengers, escape being dashed to
pieces by next door to a miracle.&nbsp; Nobody knows anything
about it but the driver and the stoker.&nbsp; I remember once,
when I was driving on the Eastern Counties.&nbsp; Going round a
curve, I suddenly saw a train coming along on the same line of
rails.&nbsp; I clapped on the brake, but it was too late, I
thought.&nbsp; Seeing the engine almost close upon us, I cried to
my stoker to jump.&nbsp; He jumped off the engine, almost before
the words were out of my mouth.&nbsp; I was just taking my hand
off the lever to follow, when the coming train turned off on the
points, and <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the next instant the hind coach
passed my engine by a shave.&nbsp; It was the nearest touch I
ever saw.&nbsp; My stoker was killed.&nbsp; In another half
second I should have jumped off and been killed too.&nbsp; What
would have become of the train without us is more than I can tell
you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are heaps of people run over, that no one ever
hears about.&nbsp; One dark night in the Black Country, me and my
mate felt something wet and warm splash in our faces.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That didn&rsquo;t come from the engine, Bill,&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
something thick, Jim.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was blood.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what it was.&nbsp; We heard afterwards that a
collier had been run over.&nbsp; When we kill any of our own
chaps, we say as little about it as possible.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
generally&mdash;mostly always&mdash;their own fault.&nbsp; No, we
never think of danger ourselves.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re used to it,
you see.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;re not reckless.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe there&rsquo;s any body of men that takes more pride in
their work than engine-drivers do.&nbsp; We are as proud and as
fond of our engines as if they were living things; as proud of
them as a huntsman or a jockey is of his horse.&nbsp; And a
engine has almost as many ways as a horse; she&rsquo;s a kicker,
a plunger, a roarer, or what not, in her way.&nbsp; Put a
stranger on to my engine, and he wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do
with her.&nbsp; Yes; there&rsquo;s wonderful improvements in
engines since the last great Exhibition.&nbsp; Some of them <!--
page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>take up their water without stopping.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a wonderful invention, and yet as simple as A B
C.&nbsp; There are water-troughs at certain places, lying between
the rails.&nbsp; By moving a lever you let down the mouth of a
scoop into the water, and as you rush along the water is forced
into the tank, at the rate of three thousand gallons a
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A engine-driver&rsquo;s chief anxiety is to keep time;
that&rsquo;s what he thinks most of.&nbsp; When I was driving the
Brighton express, I always felt like as if I was riding a race
against time.&nbsp; I had no fear of the pace; what I feared was
losing way, and not getting in to the minute.&nbsp; We have to
give in an account of our time when we arrive.&nbsp; The company
provides us with watches, and we go by them.&nbsp; Before
starting on a journey, we pass through a room to be
inspected.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s to see if we are sober.&nbsp; But
they don&rsquo;t say nothing to us, and a man who was a little
gone might pass easy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known a stoker that had
passed the inspection, come on to the engine as drunk as a fly,
flop down among the coals, and sleep there like a log for the
whole run.&nbsp; I had to be my own stoker then.&nbsp; If you ask
me if engine-drivers are drinking men, I must answer you that
they are pretty well.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s trying work; one half of
you cold as ice; t&rsquo;other half hot as fire; wet one minute,
dry the next.&nbsp; If ever a man had an excuse for drinking,
that man&rsquo;s <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>a engine-driver.&nbsp; And yet I
don&rsquo;t know if ever a driver goes upon his engine
drunk.&nbsp; If he was to, the wind would soon sober him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe engine-drivers, as a body, are the healthiest
fellows alive; but they don&rsquo;t live long.&nbsp; The cause of
that, I believe to be the cold food, and the shaking.&nbsp; By
the cold food, I mean that a engine-driver never gets his meals
comfortable.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s never at home to his dinner.&nbsp;
When he starts away the first thing in the morning, he takes a
bit of cold meat and a piece of bread with him for his dinner;
and generally he has to eat it in the shed, for he mustn&rsquo;t
leave his engine.&nbsp; You can understand how the jolting and
shaking knocks a man up, after a bit.&nbsp; The insurance
companies won&rsquo;t take us at ordinary rates.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re obliged to be Foresters, or Old Friends, or that sort
of thing, where they ain&rsquo;t so particular.&nbsp; The wages
of a engine-driver average about eight shillings a day, but if
he&rsquo;s a good schemer with his coals&mdash;yes, I mean if he
economises his coals&mdash;he&rsquo;s allowed so much more.&nbsp;
Some will make from five to ten shillings a week that way.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t complain of the wages particular; but it&rsquo;s
hard lines for such as us, to have to pay income-tax.&nbsp; The
company gives an account of all our wages, and we have to
pay.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our domestic life&mdash;our life at home, you
mean?&nbsp; Well, as to that, we don&rsquo;t see much <!-- page
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>of
our families.&nbsp; I leave home at half-past seven in the
morning, and don&rsquo;t get back again until half-past nine, or
maybe later.&nbsp; The children are not up when I leave, and
they&rsquo;ve gone to bed again before I come home.&nbsp; This is
about my day:&mdash;Leave London at 8.45; drive for four hours
and a half; cold snack on the engine step; see to engine; drive
back again; clean engine; report myself; and home.&nbsp; Twelve
hours&rsquo; hard and anxious work, and no comfortable
victuals.&nbsp; Yes, our wives are anxious about us; for we never
know when we go out, if we&rsquo;ll ever come back again.&nbsp;
We ought to go home the minute we leave the station, and report
ourselves to those that are thinking on us and depending on us;
but I&rsquo;m afraid we don&rsquo;t always.&nbsp; Perhaps we go
first to the public-house, and perhaps you would, too, if you
were in charge of a engine all day long.&nbsp; But the wives have
a way of their own, of finding out if we&rsquo;re all
right.&nbsp; They inquire among each other.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you
seen my Jim?&rsquo; one says.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says
another, &lsquo;but Jack see him coming out of the station half
an hour ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she knows that her Jim&rsquo;s all
right, and knows where to find him if she wants him.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a sad thing when any of us have to carry bad news to a
mate&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; None of us likes that job.&nbsp; I
remember when Jack Davidge was killed, none of us could face his
poor <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>missus with the news.&nbsp; She had
seven children, poor thing, and two of &rsquo;em, the youngest,
was down with the fever.&nbsp; We got old Mrs. Berridge&mdash;Tom
Berridge&rsquo;s mother&mdash;to break it to her.&nbsp; But she
knew summat was the matter, the minute the old woman went in,
and, afore she spoke a word, fell down like as if she was
dead.&nbsp; She lay all night like that, and never heard from
mortal lips until next morning that her Jack was killed.&nbsp;
But she knew it in her heart.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pitch and toss
kind of a life ours!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I never was nervous on a engine but once.&nbsp;
I never think of my own life.&nbsp; You go in for staking that,
when you begin, and you get used to the risk.&nbsp; I never think
of the passengers either.&nbsp; The thoughts of a engine-driver
never go behind his engine.&nbsp; If he keeps his engine all
right, the coaches behind will be all right, as far as the driver
is concerned.&nbsp; But once I <i>did</i> think of the
passengers.&nbsp; My little boy, Bill, was among them that
morning.&nbsp; He was a poor little cripple fellow that we all
loved more nor the others, because he <i>was</i> a cripple, and
so quiet, and wise-like.&nbsp; He was going down to his aunt in
the country, who was to take care of him for a while.&nbsp; We
thought the country air would do him good.&nbsp; I did think
there were lives behind me that morning; at least, I thought hard
of one little life that was in <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>my
hands.&nbsp; There were twenty coaches on; my little Bill seemed
to me to be in every one of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; My hand trembled as
I turned on the steam.&nbsp; I felt my heart thumping as we drew
close to the pointsman&rsquo;s box; as we neared the Junction, I
was all in a cold sweat.&nbsp; At the end of the first fifty
miles I was nearly eleven minutes behind time.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you this morning?&rsquo; my
stoker said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you have a drop too much last
night?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me, Fred,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;till we get to Peterborough; and keep a sharp
look-out, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; I never was
so thankful in my life as when I shut off steam to enter the
station at Peterborough.&nbsp; Little Bill&rsquo;s aunt was
waiting for him, and I saw her lift him out of the
carriage.&nbsp; I called out to her to bring him to me, and I
took him upon the engine and kissed him&mdash;ah, twenty times I
should think&mdash;making him in such a mess with grease and
coal-dust as you never saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was all right for the rest of the journey.&nbsp; And
I do believe, sir, the passengers were safer after little Bill
was gone.&nbsp; It would never do, you see, for engine-drivers to
know too much, or to feel too much.&rdquo;</p>

BRANCH LINE<br />
THE COMPENSATION HOUSE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a looking-glass in all the house,
sir.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s some peculiar fancy of my
master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t one in any single room in
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a dark and gloomy-looking building, and had been
purchased by this Company for an enlargement of their Goods
Station.&nbsp; The value of the house had been referred to what
was popularly called &ldquo;a compensation jury,&rdquo; and the
house was called, in consequence, The Compensation House.&nbsp;
It had become the Company&rsquo;s property; but its tenant still
remained in possession, pending the commencement of active
building operations.&nbsp; My attention was originally drawn to
this house because it stood directly in front of a collection of
huge pieces of timber which lay near this part of the Line, and
on which I sometimes sat for half an hour at a time, when I was
tired by my wanderings about Mugby Junction.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>It was square, cold, grey-looking, built of rough-hewn
stone, and roofed with thin slabs of the same material.&nbsp; Its
windows were few in number, and very small for the size of the
building.&nbsp; In the great blank, grey broad-side, there were
only four windows.&nbsp; The entrance-door was in the middle of
the house; there was a window on either side of it, and there
were two more in the single story above.&nbsp; The blinds were
all closely drawn, and, when the door was shut, the dreary
building gave no sign of life or occupation.</p>
<p>But the door was not always shut.&nbsp; Sometimes it was
opened from within, with a great jingling of bolts and
door-chains, and then a man would come forward and stand upon the
door-step, snuffing the air as one might do who was ordinarily
kept on rather a small allowance of that element.&nbsp; He was
stout, thick-set, and perhaps fifty or sixty years old&mdash;a
man whose hair was cut exceedingly close, who wore a large bushy
beard, and whose eye had a sociable twinkle in it which was
prepossessing.&nbsp; He was dressed, whenever I saw him, in a
greenish-brown frock-coat made of some material which was not
cloth, wore a waistcoat and trousers of light colour, and had a
frill to his shirt&mdash;an ornament, by the way, which did not
seem to go at all well with the beard, which was continually in
contact with it.&nbsp; It was the custom of this <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>worthy person, after standing for a short time on the
threshold inhaling the air, to come forward into the road, and,
after glancing at one of the upper windows in a half mechanical
way, to cross over to the logs, and, leaning over the fence which
guarded the railway, to look up and down the Line (it passed
before the house) with the air of a man accomplishing a
self-imposed task of which nothing was expected to come.&nbsp;
This done, he would cross the road again, and turning on the
threshold to take a final sniff of air, disappeared once more
within the house, bolting and chaining the door again as if there
were no probability of its being reopened for at least a
week.&nbsp; Yet half an hour had not passed before he was out in
the road again, sniffing the air and looking up and down the Line
as before.</p>
<p>It was not very long before I managed to scrape acquaintance
with this restless personage.&nbsp; I soon found out that my
friend with the shirt-frill was the confidential servant, butler,
valet, factotum, what you will, of a sick gentleman, a Mr. Oswald
Strange, who had recently come to inhabit the house opposite, and
concerning whose history my new acquaintance, whose name I
ascertained was Masey, seemed disposed to be somewhat
communicative.&nbsp; His master, it appeared, had come down to
this place, partly for the sake of <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>reducing
his establishment&mdash;not, Mr. Masey was swift to inform me, on
economical principles, but because the poor gentleman, for
particular reasons, wished to have few dependents about
him&mdash;partly in order that he might be near his old friend,
Dr. Garden, who was established in the neighbourhood, and whose
society and advice were necessary to Mr. Strange&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; That life was, it appeared, held by this suffering
gentleman on a precarious tenure.&nbsp; It was ebbing away fast
with each passing hour.&nbsp; The servant already spoke of his
master in the past tense, describing him to me as a young
gentleman not more than five-and-thirty years of age, with a
young face, as far as the features and build of it went, but with
an expression which had nothing of youth about it.&nbsp; This was
the great peculiarity of the man.&nbsp; At a distance he looked
younger than he was by many years, and strangers, at the time
when he had been used to get about, always took him for a man of
seven or eight-and-twenty, but they changed their minds on
getting nearer to him.&nbsp; Old Masey had a way of his own of
summing up the peculiarities of his master, repeating twenty
times over: &ldquo;Sir, he was Strange by name, and Strange by
nature, and Strange to look at into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during my second or third interview with the old fellow
that he uttered the words quoted at the beginning of this plain
narrative.</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>&ldquo;Not such a thing as a looking-glass in all the
house,&rdquo; the old man said, standing beside my piece of
timber, and looking across reflectively at the house
opposite.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the sitting-rooms, I suppose you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I mean sitting-rooms and bedrooms both; there
isn&rsquo;t so much as a shaving-glass as big as the palm of your
hand anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how is it?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are
there no looking-glasses in any of the rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; replied Masey, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what
none of us can ever tell.&nbsp; There is the mystery.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s just a fancy on the part of my master.&nbsp; He had
some strange fancies, and this was one of them.&nbsp; A pleasant
gentleman he was to live with, as any servant could desire.&nbsp;
A liberal gentleman, and one who gave but little trouble; always
ready with a kind word, and a kind deed, too, for the matter of
that.&nbsp; There was not a house in all the parish of St.
George&rsquo;s (in which we lived before we came down here) where
the servants had more holidays or a better table kept; but, for
all that, he had his queer ways and his fancies, as I may call
them, and this was one of them.&nbsp; And the point he made of
it, sir,&rdquo; the old man went on; &ldquo;the extent to which
that regulation was enforced, whenever a new servant was engaged;
and the changes in the establishment it occasioned.&nbsp; In
hiring a new servant, the very first stipulation made, was that
about the looking-glasses.&nbsp; It <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>was one of
my duties to explain the thing, as far as it could be explained,
before any servant was taken into the house.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find it an easy place,&rsquo; I used to say,
&lsquo;with a liberal table, good wages, and a deal of leisure;
but there&rsquo;s one thing you must make up your mind to; you
must do without looking-glasses while you&rsquo;re here, for
there isn&rsquo;t one in the house, and, what&rsquo;s more, there
never will be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you know there never would be one?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless you, sir!&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d seen
and heard all that I&rsquo;d seen and heard, you could have no
doubt about it.&nbsp; Why, only to take one instance:&mdash;I
remember a particular day when my master had occasion to go into
the housekeeper&rsquo;s room where the cook lived, to see about
some alterations that were making, and when a pretty scene took
place.&nbsp; The cook&mdash;she was a very ugly woman, and awful
vain&mdash;had left a little bit of looking-glass, about six
inches square, upon the chimney-piece; she had got it
<i>surreptious</i>, and kept it always locked up; but she&rsquo;d
left it out, being called away suddenly, while titivating her
hair.&nbsp; I had seen the glass, and was making for the
chimney-piece as fast as I could; but master came in front of it
before I could get there, and it was all over in a moment.&nbsp;
He gave one long piercing look into it, turned deadly pale, and
seizing the glass, dashed it <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>into a
hundred pieces on the floor, and then stamped upon the fragments
and ground them into powder with his feet.&nbsp; He shut himself
up for the rest of that day in his own room, first ordering me to
discharge the cook, then and there, at a moment&rsquo;s
notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary thing!&rdquo; I said,
pondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; continued the old man, &ldquo;it was
astonishing what trouble I had with those women-servants.&nbsp;
It was difficult to get any that would take the place at all
under the circumstances.&nbsp; &lsquo;What not so much as a
mossul to do one&rsquo;s &rsquo;air at?&rsquo; they would say,
and they&rsquo;d go off, in spite of extra wages.&nbsp; Then
those who did consent to come, what lies they would tell, to be
sure!&nbsp; They would protest that they didn&rsquo;t want to
look in the glass, that they never had been in the habit of
looking in the glass, and all the while that very wench would
have her looking-glass of some kind or another, hid away among
her clothes up-stairs.&nbsp; Sooner or later, she would bring it
out too, and leave it about somewhere or other (just like the
cook), where it was as likely as not that master might see
it.&nbsp; And then&mdash;for girls like that have no consciences,
sir&mdash;when I had caught one of &rsquo;em at it, she&rsquo;d
turn round as bold as brass, &lsquo;And how am I to know whether
my &rsquo;air&rsquo;s parted straight?&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say,
just as if it hadn&rsquo;t been considered in her wages that that
was the <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>very thing which she never
<i>was</i> to know while she lived in our house.&nbsp; A vain
lot, sir, and the ugly ones always the vainest.&nbsp; There was
no end to their dodges.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d have looking-glasses
in the interiors of their workbox-lids, where it was next to
impossible that I could find &rsquo;em, or inside the covers of
hymn-books, or cookery-books, or in their caddies.&nbsp; I
recollect one girl, a sly one she was, and marked with the
small-pox terrible, who was always reading her prayer-book at odd
times.&nbsp; Sometimes I used to think what a religious mind
she&rsquo;d got, and at other times (depending on the mood I was
in) I would conclude that it was the marriage-service she was
studying; but one day, when I got behind her to satisfy my
doubts&mdash;lo and behold! it was the old story: a bit of glass,
without a frame, fastened into the kiver with the outside edges
of the sheets of postage-stamps.&nbsp; Dodges!&nbsp; Why
they&rsquo;d keep their looking-glasses in the scullery or the
coal-cellar, or leave them in charge of the servants next door,
or with the milk-woman round the corner; but have &rsquo;em they
would.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t mind confessing, sir,&rdquo; said
the old man, bringing his long speech to an end, &ldquo;that it
<i>was</i> an inconveniency not to have so much as a scrap to
shave before.&nbsp; I used to go to the barber&rsquo;s at first,
but I soon gave that up, and took to wearing my beard as my
master did; likewise to keeping my hair&rdquo;<!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>&mdash;Mr.
Masey touched his head as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;so short, that it
didn&rsquo;t require any parting, before or behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat for some time lost in amazement, and staring at my
companion.&nbsp; My curiosity was powerfully stimulated, and the
desire to learn more was very strong within me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had your master any personal defect,&rdquo; I inquired,
&ldquo;which might have made it distressing to him to see his own
image reflected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, sir,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was as handsome a gentleman as you would wish to see: a
little delicate-looking and careworn, perhaps, with a very pale
face; but as free from any deformity as you or I, sir.&nbsp; No,
sir, no; it was nothing of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what was it?&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo; I asked,
desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there no one who is, or has been, in
your master&rsquo;s confidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the old fellow, with his eyes
turning to that window opposite.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is one person
who knows all my master&rsquo;s secrets, and this secret among
the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man turned round and looked at me fixedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The doctor here,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dr.
Garden.&nbsp; My master&rsquo;s very old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to speak with this gentleman,&rdquo; I
said, involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is with my master now,&rdquo; answered Masey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He will be coming out presently, <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>and I think
I may say he will answer any question you may like to put to
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the old man spoke, the door of the house
opened, and a middle-aged gentleman, who was tall and thin, but
who lost something of his height by a habit of stooping, appeared
on the step.&nbsp; Old Masey left me in a moment.&nbsp; He
muttered something about taking the doctor&rsquo;s directions,
and hastened across the road.&nbsp; The tall gentleman spoke to
him for a minute or two very seriously, probably about the
patient up-stairs, and it then seemed to me from their gestures
that I myself was the subject of some further conversation
between them.&nbsp; At all events, when old Masey retired into
the house, the doctor came across to where I was standing, and
addressed me with a very agreeable smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Masey tells me that you are interested in the case
of my poor friend, sir.&nbsp; I am now going back to my house,
and if you don&rsquo;t mind the trouble of walking with me, I
shall be happy to enlighten you as far as I am able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hastened to make my apologies and express my
acknowledgments, and we set off together.&nbsp; When we had
reached the doctor&rsquo;s house and were seated in his study, I
ventured to inquire after the health of this poor gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there is no amendment, nor any prospect of
amendment,&rdquo; said the doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Masey has
told you something of his strange condition, has he
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;Yes, he has told me something,&rdquo; I
answered, &ldquo;and he says you know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Garden looked very grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
all about it.&nbsp; I only know what happens when he comes into
the presence of a looking-glass.&nbsp; But as to the
circumstances which have led to his being haunted in the
strangest fashion that I ever heard of, I know no more of them
than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haunted?&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;And in the
strangest fashion that you ever heard of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Garden smiled at my eagerness, seemed to be collecting his
thoughts, and presently went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made the acquaintance of Mr. Oswald Strange in a
curious way.&nbsp; It was on board of an Italian steamer, bound
from Civita Vecchia to Marseilles.&nbsp; We had been travelling
all night.&nbsp; In the morning I was shaving myself in the
cabin, when suddenly this man came behind me, glanced for a
moment into the small mirror before which I was standing, and
then, without a word of warning, tore it from the nail, and
dashed it to pieces at my feet.&nbsp; His face was at first livid
with passion&mdash;it seemed to me rather the passion of fear
than of anger&mdash;but it changed after a moment, and he seemed
ashamed of what he had done.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; continued the
doctor, relapsing for a moment into a smile, &ldquo;of course I
was in a devil of a rage.&nbsp; I was operating on my under-jaw,
and <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>the start the thing gave me caused
me to cut myself.&nbsp; Besides, altogether it seemed an
outrageous and insolent thing, and I gave it to poor Strange in a
style of language which I am sorry to think of now, but which, I
hope, was excusable at the time.&nbsp; As to the offender
himself, his confusion and regret, now that his passion was at an
end, disarmed me.&nbsp; He sent for the steward, and paid most
liberally for the damage done to the steam-boat property,
explaining to him, and to some other passengers who were present
in the cabin, that what had happened had been accidental.&nbsp;
For me, however, he had another explanation.&nbsp; Perhaps he
felt that I must know it to have been no accident&mdash;perhaps
he really wished to confide in some one.&nbsp; At all events, he
owned to me that what he had done was done under the influence of
an uncontrollable impulse&mdash;a seizure which took him, he
said, at times&mdash;something like a fit.&nbsp; He begged my
pardon, and entreated that I would endeavour to disassociate him
personally from this action, of which he was heartily
ashamed.&nbsp; Then he attempted a sickly joke, poor fellow,
about his wearing a beard, and feeling a little spiteful, in
consequence, when he saw other people taking the trouble to
shave; but he said nothing about any infirmity or delusion, and
shortly after left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my professional capacity I could not <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>help taking some interest in Mr. Strange.&nbsp; I did
not altogether lose sight of him after our sea-journey to
Marseilles was over.&nbsp; I found him a pleasant companion up to
a certain point; but I always felt that there was a reserve about
him.&nbsp; He was uncommunicative about his past life, and
especially would never allude to anything connected with his
travels or his residence in Italy, which, however, I could make
out had been a long one.&nbsp; He spoke Italian well, and seemed
familiar with the country, but disliked to talk about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the time we spent together there were seasons
when he was so little himself, that I, with a pretty large
experience, was almost afraid to be with him.&nbsp; His attacks
were violent and sudden in the last degree; and there was one
most extraordinary feature connected with them all:&mdash;some
horrible association of ideas took possession of him whenever he
found himself before a looking-glass.&nbsp; And after we had
travelled together for a time, I dreaded the sight of a mirror
hanging harmlessly against a wall, or a toilet-glass standing on
a dressing-table, almost as much as he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Strange was not always affected in the same manner
by a looking-glass.&nbsp; Sometimes it seemed to madden him with
fury; at other times, it appeared to turn him to stone: remaining
motionless and speechless as if <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>attacked by
catalepsy.&nbsp; One night&mdash;the worst things always happen
at night, and oftener than one would think on stormy
nights&mdash;we arrived at a small town in the central district
of Auvergne: a place but little known, out of the line of
railways, and to which we had been drawn, partly by the
antiquarian attractions which the place possessed, and partly by
the beauty of the scenery.&nbsp; The weather had been rather
against us.&nbsp; The day had been dull and murky, the heat
stifling, and the sky had threatened mischief since the
morning.&nbsp; At sundown, these threats were fulfilled.&nbsp;
The thunderstorm, which had been all day coming up&mdash;as it
seemed to us, against the wind&mdash;burst over the place where
we were lodged, with very great violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some practical-minded persons with strong
constitutions, who deny roundly that their fellow-creatures are,
or can be, affected, in mind or body, by atmospheric
influences.&nbsp; I am not a disciple of that school, simply
because I cannot believe that those changes of weather, which
have so much effect upon animals, and even on inanimate objects,
can fail to have some influence on a piece of machinery so
sensitive and intricate as the human frame.&nbsp; I think, then,
that it was in part owing to the disturbed state of the
atmosphere that, on this particular evening I felt nervous and
depressed.&nbsp; When my new <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>friend
Strange and I parted for the night, I felt as little disposed to
go to rest as I ever did in my life.&nbsp; The thunder was still
lingering among the mountains in the midst of which our inn was
placed.&nbsp; Sometimes it seemed nearer, and at other times
further off; but it never left off altogether, except for a few
minutes at a time.&nbsp; I was quite unable to shake off a
succession of painful ideas which persistently besieged my
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly necessary to add that I thought from time
to time of my travelling-companion in the next room.&nbsp; His
image was almost continually before me.&nbsp; He had been dull
and depressed all the evening, and when we parted for the night
there was a look in his eyes which I could not get out of my
memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a door between our rooms, and the partition
dividing them was not very solid; and yet I had heard no sound
since I parted from him which could indicate that he was there at
all, much less that he was awake and stirring.&nbsp; I was in a
mood, sir, which made this silence terrible to me, and so many
foolish fancies&mdash;as that he was lying there dead, or in a
fit, or what not&mdash;took possession of me, that at last I
could bear it no longer.&nbsp; I went to the door, and, after
listening, very attentively but quite in vain, for any sound, I
at last knocked pretty sharply.&nbsp; There was no <!-- page
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>answer.&nbsp; Feeling that longer suspense would be
unendurable, I, without more ceremony, turned the handle and went
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great bare room, and so imperfectly lighted by
a single candle that it was almost impossible&mdash;except when
the lightning flashed&mdash;to see into its great dark
corners.&nbsp; A small rickety bedstead stood against one of the
walls, shrouded by yellow cotton curtains, passed through a great
iron ring in the ceiling.&nbsp; There was, for all other
furniture, an old chest of drawers which served also as a
washing-stand, having a small basin and ewer and a single towel
arranged on the top of it.&nbsp; There were, moreover, two
ancient chairs and a dressing-table.&nbsp; On this last, stood a
large old-fashioned looking-glass with a carved frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have seen all these things, because I remember
them so well now, but I do not know how I could have seen them,
for it seems to me that, from the moment of my entering that
room, the action of my senses and of the faculties of my mind was
held fast by the ghastly figure which stood motionless before the
looking-glass in the middle of the empty room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible it was!&nbsp; The weak light of one candle
standing on the table shone upon Strange&rsquo;s face, lighting
it from below, and throwing (as I now remember) his shadow, <!--
page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>vast and black, upon the wall behind him and upon the
ceiling overhead.&nbsp; He was leaning rather forward, with his
hands upon the table supporting him, and gazing into the glass
which stood before him with a horrible fixity.&nbsp; The sweat
was on his white face; his rigid features and his pale lips
showed in that feeble light were horrible, more than words can
tell, to look at.&nbsp; He was so completely stupefied and lost,
that the noise I had made in knocking and in entering the room
was unobserved by him.&nbsp; Not even when I called him loudly by
name did he move or did his face change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a vision of horror that was, in the great dark
empty room, in a silence that was something more than negative,
that ghastly figure frozen into stone by some unexplained
terror!&nbsp; And the silence and the stillness!&nbsp; The very
thunder had ceased now.&nbsp; My heart stood still with
fear.&nbsp; Then, moved by some instinctive feeling, under whose
influence I acted mechanically, I crept with slow steps nearer
and nearer to the table, and at last, half expecting to see some
spectre even more horrible than this which I saw already, I
looked over his shoulder into the looking-glass.&nbsp; I happened
to touch his arm, though only in the lightest manner.&nbsp; In
that one moment the spell which had held him&mdash;who knows how
long?&mdash;enchained, seemed broken, and he <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>lived in
this world again.&nbsp; He turned round upon me, as suddenly as a
tiger makes its spring, and seized me by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you that even before I entered my
friend&rsquo;s room I had felt, all that night, depressed and
nervous.&nbsp; The necessity for action at this time was,
however, so obvious, and this man&rsquo;s agony made all that I
had felt, appear so trifling, that much of my own discomfort
seemed to leave me.&nbsp; I felt that I <i>must</i> be
strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The face before me almost unmanned me.&nbsp; The eyes
which looked into mine were so scared with terror, the
lips&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;looked so speechless.&nbsp; The
wretched man gazed long into my face, and then, still holding me
by the arm, slowly, very slowly, turned his head.&nbsp; I had
gently tried to move him away from the looking-glass, but he
would not stir, and now he was looking into it as fixedly as
ever.&nbsp; I could bear this no longer, and, using such force as
was necessary, I drew him gradually away, and got him to one of
the chairs at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; I
said&mdash;after the long silence my voice, even to myself,
sounded strange and hollow&mdash;&rsquo;come!&nbsp; You are
over-tired, and you feel the weather.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think
you ought to be in bed?&nbsp; Suppose you lie down.&nbsp; Let me
try my medical skill in mixing you a composing
draught.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>&ldquo;He held my hand, and looked eagerly into my
eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am better now,&rsquo; he said, speaking at
last very faintly.&nbsp; Still he looked at me in that wistful
way.&nbsp; It seemed as if there were something that he wanted to
do or say, but had not sufficient resolution.&nbsp; At length he
got up from the chair to which I had led him, and beckoning me to
follow him, went across the room to the dressing-table, and stood
again before the glass.&nbsp; A violent shudder passed through
his frame as he looked into it; but apparently forcing himself to
go through with what he had now begun, he remained where he was,
and, without looking away, moved to me with his hand to come and
stand beside him.&nbsp; I complied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look in there!&rsquo; he said, in an almost
inaudible tone.&nbsp; He was supported, as before, by his hands
resting on the table, and could only bow with his head towards
the glass to intimate what he meant.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look in
there!&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did as he asked me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you see?&rsquo; he asked next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See?&rsquo; I repeated, trying to speak as
cheerfully as I could, and describing the reflexion of his own
face as nearly as I could.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see a very, very pale
face with sunken cheeks&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What?&rsquo; he cried, with an alarm in his
voice which I could not understand.</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;With sunken cheeks,&rsquo; I went on,
&lsquo;and two hollow eyes with large pupils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the reflexion of my friend&rsquo;s face change,
and felt his hand clutch my arm even more tightly than he had
done before.&nbsp; I stopped abruptly and looked round at
him.&nbsp; He did not turn his head towards me, but, gazing still
into the looking-glass, seemed to labour for utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; he stammered at last.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you&mdash;see it&mdash;too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See what?&rsquo; I asked, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That face!&rsquo; he cried, in accents of
horror.&nbsp; &lsquo;That face&mdash;which is not mine&mdash;and
which&mdash;<span class="smcap">I see instead of
mine</span>&mdash;always!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was struck speechless by the words.&nbsp; In a moment
this mystery was explained&mdash;but what an explanation!&nbsp;
Worse, a hundred times worse, than anything I had imagined.&nbsp;
What!&nbsp; Had this man lost the power of seeing his own image
as it was reflected there before him? and, in its place, was
there the image of another?&nbsp; Had he changed reflexions with
some other man?&nbsp; The frightfulness of the thought struck me
speechless for a time&mdash;then I saw how false an impression my
silence was conveying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; I cried, as soon as I could
speak&mdash;&lsquo;a hundred times, no!&nbsp; I see you, of
course, and only you.&nbsp; It was your face I attempted to
describe, and no other.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;He seemed not to hear me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, look
there!&rsquo; he said, in a low, indistinct voice, pointing to
his own image in the glass.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whose face do you see
there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why yours, of course.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then,
after a moment, I added, &lsquo;Whose do you see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He answered, like one in a trance,
&lsquo;<i>His</i>&mdash;only his&mdash;always his!&rsquo;&nbsp;
He stood still a moment, and then, with a loud and terrific
scream, repeated those words, &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Always
his</span>, <span class="smcap">always his</span>,&rsquo; and
fell down in a fit before me.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew what to do now.&nbsp; Here was a thing which, at
any rate, I could understand.&nbsp; I had with me my usual small
stock of medicines and surgical instruments, and I did what was
necessary: first to restore my unhappy patient, and next to
procure for him the rest he needed so much.&nbsp; He was very
ill&mdash;at death&rsquo;s door for some days&mdash;and I could
not leave him, though there was urgent need that I should be back
in London.&nbsp; When he began to mend, I sent over to England
for my servant&mdash;John Masey&mdash;whom I knew I could
trust.&nbsp; Acquainting him with the outlines of the case, I
left him in charge of my patient, with orders that he should be
brought over to this country as soon as he was fit to travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That awful scene was always before me.&nbsp; I saw this
devoted man day after day, with the eyes of my imagination,
sometimes destroying in <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>his rage
the harmless looking-glass, which was the immediate cause of his
suffering, sometimes transfixed before the horrid image that
turned him to stone.&nbsp; I recollect coming upon him once when
we were stopping at a roadside inn, and seeing him stand so by
broad daylight.&nbsp; His back was turned towards me, and I
waited and watched him for nearly half an hour as he stood there
motionless and speechless, and appearing not to breathe.&nbsp; I
am not sure but that this apparition seen so by daylight was more
ghastly than that apparition seen in the middle of the night,
with the thunder rumbling among the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back in London in his own house, where he could command
in some sort the objects which should surround him, poor Strange
was better than he would have been elsewhere.&nbsp; He seldom
went out except at night, but once or twice I have walked with
him by daylight, and have seen him terribly agitated when we have
had to pass a shop in which looking-glasses were exposed for
sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nearly a year now since my poor friend followed
me down to this place, to which I have retired.&nbsp; For some
months he has been daily getting weaker and weaker, and a disease
of the lungs has become developed in him, which has brought him
to his death-bed.&nbsp; I should add, by-the-by, that John Masey
has been his constant companion ever since I brought them <!--
page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>together, and I have had, consequently, to look after a
new servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me,&rdquo; the doctor added, bringing his
tale to an end, &ldquo;did you ever hear a more miserable
history, or was ever man haunted in a more ghastly manner than
this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to reply when I heard a sound of footsteps
outside, and before I could speak old Masey entered the room, in
haste and disorder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just telling this gentleman,&rdquo; the doctor
said: not at the moment observing old Masey&rsquo;s changed
manner: &ldquo;how you deserted me to go over to your present
master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir,&rdquo; the man answered, in a troubled voice,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he won&rsquo;t be my master
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor was on his legs in a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Is he worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, sir, he is dying,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, sir; you may be of use if you can keep
quiet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor caught up his hat as he addressed
me in those words, and in a few minutes we had reached The
Compensation House.&nbsp; A few seconds more, and we were
standing in a darkened room on the first floor, and I saw lying
on a bed before me&mdash;pale, emaciated, and, as it seemed,
dying&mdash;the man whose story I had just heard.</p>
<p>He was lying with closed eyes when we came into the room, and
I had leisure to examine his <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>features.&nbsp; What a tale of misery they told!&nbsp;
They were regular and symmetrical in their arrangement, and not
without beauty&mdash;the beauty of exceeding refinement and
delicacy.&nbsp; Force there was none, and perhaps it was to the
want of this that the faults&mdash;perhaps the crime&mdash;which
had made the man&rsquo;s life so miserable were to be
attributed.&nbsp; Perhaps the crime?&nbsp; Yes, it was not likely
that an affliction, lifelong and terrible, such as this he had
endured, would come upon him unless some misdeed had provoked the
punishment.&nbsp; What misdeed we were soon to know.</p>
<p>It sometimes&mdash;I think generally&mdash;happens that the
presence of any one who stands and watches beside a sleeping man
will wake him, unless his slumbers are unusually heavy.&nbsp; It
was so now.&nbsp; While we looked at him, the sleeper awoke very
suddenly, and fixed his eyes upon us.&nbsp; He put out his hand
and took the doctor&rsquo;s in its feeble grasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
is that?&rdquo; he asked next, pointing towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish him to go?&nbsp; The gentleman knows
something of your sufferings, and is powerfully interested in
your case; but he will leave us, if you wish it,&rdquo; the
doctor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Let him stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seating myself out of sight, but where I could both see and
hear what passed, I waited for what should follow.&nbsp; Dr.
Garden and John <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>Masey stood beside the bed.&nbsp;
There was a moment&rsquo;s pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a looking-glass,&rdquo; said Strange, without a
word of preface.</p>
<p>We all started to hear him say those words.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
dying,&rdquo; said Strange; &ldquo;will you not grant me my
request?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Garden whispered to old Masey; and the latter left the
room.&nbsp; He was not absent long, having gone no further than
the next house.&nbsp; He held an oval-framed mirror in his hand
when he returned.&nbsp; A shudder passed through the body of the
sick man as he saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it down,&rdquo; he said,
faintly&mdash;&ldquo;anywhere&mdash;for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one of us spoke.&nbsp; I do not think, in that moment of
suspense, that we could, any of us, have spoken if we had
tried.</p>
<p>The sick man tried to raise himself a little.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Prop me up,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I speak with
difficulty&mdash;I have something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They put pillows behind him, so as to raise his head and
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have presently a use for it,&rdquo; he said,
indicating the mirror.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
see&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped, and seemed to change his
mind.&nbsp; He was sparing of his words.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
tell you&mdash;all about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he was
silent.&nbsp; Then he seemed to make a great effort and spoke
once more, beginning very abruptly.</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;I loved my wife fondly.&nbsp; I loved
her&mdash;her name was Lucy.&nbsp; She was English; but, after we
were married, we lived long abroad&mdash;in Italy.&nbsp; She
liked the country, and I liked what she liked.&nbsp; She liked to
draw, too, and I got her a master.&nbsp; He was an Italian.&nbsp;
I will not give his name.&nbsp; We always called him &lsquo;the
Master.&rsquo;&nbsp; A treacherous insidious man this was, and,
under cover of his profession, took advantage of his
opportunities, and taught my wife to love him&mdash;to love
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am short of breath.&nbsp; I need not enter into
details as to how I found them out; but I did find them
out.&nbsp; We were away on a sketching expedition when I made my
discovery.&nbsp; My rage maddened me, and there was one at hand
who fomented my madness.&nbsp; My wife had a maid, who, it
seemed, had also loved this man&mdash;the Master&mdash;and had
been ill treated and deserted by him.&nbsp; She told me
all.&nbsp; She had played the part of go-between&mdash;had
carried letters.&nbsp; When she told me these things, it was
night, in a solitary Italian town, among the mountains.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is in his room now,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;writing to
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A frenzy took possession of me as I listened to those
words.&nbsp; I am naturally vindictive&mdash;remember
that&mdash;and now my longing for revenge was like a
thirst.&nbsp; Travelling in those lonely regions, I was armed,
and when the woman said, &lsquo;He is writing to your
wife,&rsquo; <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>I laid hold of my pistols, as by an
instinct.&nbsp; It has been some comfort to me since, that I took
them both.&nbsp; Perhaps, at that moment, I may have meant fairly
by him&mdash;meant that we should fight.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what I meant, quite.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;He is
in his own room now, writing to her,&rsquo; rung in my
ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man stopped to take breath.&nbsp; It seemed an hour,
though it was probably not more than two minutes, before he spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I managed to get into his room unobserved.&nbsp;
Indeed, he was altogether absorbed in what he was doing.&nbsp; He
was sitting at the only table in the room, writing at a
travelling-desk, by the light of a single candle.&nbsp; It was a
rude dressing-table, and&mdash;and before him&mdash;exactly
before him&mdash;there was&mdash;there was a looking-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stole up behind him as he sat and wrote by the light
of the candle.&nbsp; I looked over his shoulder at the letter,
and I read, &lsquo;Dearest Lucy, my love, my
darling.&rsquo;&nbsp; As I read the words, I pulled the trigger
of the pistol I held in my right hand, and killed
him&mdash;killed him&mdash;but, before he died, he looked up
once&mdash;not at me, but at my image before him in the glass,
and his face&mdash;such a face&mdash;has been there&mdash;ever
since, and mine&mdash;my face&mdash;is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell back exhausted, and we all pressed forward thinking
that he must be dead, he lay so still.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>But he had not yet passed away.&nbsp; He revived under
the influence of stimulants.&nbsp; He tried to speak, and
muttered indistinctly from time to time words of which we could
sometimes make no sense.&nbsp; We understood, however, that he
had been tried by an Italian tribunal, and had been found guilty;
but with such extenuating circumstances that his sentence was
commuted to imprisonment, during, we thought we made out, two
years.&nbsp; But we could not understand what he said about his
wife, though we gathered that she was still alive, from something
he whispered to the doctor of there being provision made for her
in his will.</p>
<p>He lay in a doze for something more than an hour after he had
told his tale, and then he woke up quite suddenly, as he had done
when we had first entered the room.&nbsp; He looked round
uneasily in all directions, until his eye fell on the
looking-glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want it,&rdquo; he said, hastily; but I noticed that
he did not shudder now, as it was brought near.&nbsp; When old
Masey approached, holding it in his hand, and crying like a
child, Dr. Garden came forward and stood between him and his
master, taking the hand of poor Strange in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this wise?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it good,
do you think, to revive this misery of your life now, when it is
so near its close?&nbsp; The chastisement of your crime,&rdquo;
he added, solemnly, &ldquo;has <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>been a
terrible one.&nbsp; Let us hope in God&rsquo;s mercy that your
punishment is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dying man raised himself with a last great effort, and
looked up at the doctor with such an expression on his face as
none of us had seen on any face, before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope so,&rdquo; he said, faintly, &ldquo;but you
must let me have my way in this&mdash;for if, now, when I look, I
see aright&mdash;once more&mdash;I shall then hope yet more
strongly&mdash;for I shall take it as a sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor stood aside without another word, when he heard the
dying man speak thus, and the old servant drew near, and,
stooping over softly, held the looking-glass before his
master.&nbsp; Presently afterwards, we, who stood around looking
breathlessly at him, saw such a rapture upon his face, as left no
doubt upon our minds that the face which had haunted him so long,
had, in his last hour, disappeared.</p>

BRANCH LINE<br />
THE TRAVELLING POST-OFFICE</h2>
<p>Many years ago, and before this Line was so much as projected,
I was engaged as a clerk in a Travelling Post-office running
along the Line of railway from London to a town in the Midland
Counties, which we will call Fazeley.&nbsp; My duties were to
accompany the mail-train which left Fazeley at 8.15 <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and arrived in London about midnight,
and to return by the day mail leaving London at 10.30 the
following morning, after which I had an unbroken night at
Fazeley, while another clerk discharged the same round of work;
and in this way each alternative evening I was on duty in the
railway post-office van.&nbsp; At first I suffered a little from
a hurry and tremor of nerve in pursuing my occupation while the
train was crashing along under bridges and through tunnels at a
speed which was then thought marvellous and perilous; but it was
not long before my hands and eyes <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>became
accustomed to the motion of the carriage, and I could go through
my business with the same despatch and ease as in the post-office
of the country town where I had learned it, and from which I had
been promoted by the influence of the surveyor of the district,
Mr. Huntingdon.&nbsp; In fact, the work soon fell into a
monotonous routine, which, night after night, was pursued in an
unbroken course by myself and the junior clerk, who was my only
assistant: the railway post-office work not having then attained
the importance and magnitude it now possesses.</p>
<p>Our route lay through an agricultural district containing many
small towns, which made up two or three bags only; one for
London; another perhaps for the county town; a third for the
railway post-office, to be opened by us, and the enclosures to be
distributed according to their various addresses.&nbsp; The
clerks in many of these small offices were women, as is very
generally the case still, being the daughters and female
relatives of the nominal postmaster, who transact most of the
business of the office, and whose names are most frequently
signed upon the bills accompanying the bags.&nbsp; I was a young
man, and somewhat more curious in feminine handwriting than I am
now.&nbsp; There was one family in particular, whom I had never
seen, but with whose signatures I was perfectly
familiar&mdash;clear, <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>delicate, and educated, very unlike
the miserable scrawl upon other letter-bills.&nbsp; One New
Year&rsquo;s-eve, in a moment of sentiment, I tied a slip of
paper among a bundle of letters for their office, upon which I
had written, &ldquo;A happy New Year to you all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
next evening brought me a return of my good wishes, signed, as I
guessed, by three sisters of the name of Clifton.&nbsp; From that
day, every now and then, a sentence or two as brief as the one
above passed between us, and the feeling of acquaintance and
friendship grew upon me, though I had never yet had an
opportunity of seeing my fair unknown friends.</p>
<p>It was towards the close of the following October that it came
under my notice that the then Premier of the ministry was paying
an autumn visit to a nobleman, whose country seat was situated
near a small village on our line of rail.&nbsp; The
Premier&rsquo;s despatch-box, containing, of course, all the
despatches which it was necessary to send down to him, passed
between him and the Secretary of State, and was, as usual,
entrusted to the care of the post-office.&nbsp; The Continent was
just then in a more than ordinarily critical state; we were
thought to be upon the verge of an European war; and there were
murmurs floating about, at the dispersion of the ministry up and
down the country.&nbsp; These circumstances made the <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>charge of the despatch-box the more interesting to
me.&nbsp; It was very similar in size and shape to the
old-fashioned workboxes used by ladies before boxes of polished
and ornamental wood came into vogue, and, like them, it was
covered with red morocco leather, and it fastened with a lock and
key.&nbsp; The first time it came into my hands I took such
special notice of it as might be expected.&nbsp; Upon one corner
of the lid I detected a peculiar device scratched slightly upon
it, most probably with the sharp point of a steel pen, in such a
moment of preoccupation of mind as causes most of us to draw odd
lines and caricatured faces upon any piece of paper which may lie
under our hand.&nbsp; It was the old revolutionary device of a
heart with a dagger piercing it; and I wondered whether it could
be the Premier, or one of his secretaries, who had traced it upon
the morocco.</p>
<p>This box had been travelling up and down for about ten days,
and, as the village did not make up a bag for London, there being
very few letters excepting those from the great house, the
letter-bag from the house, and the despatch-box, were handed
direct into our travelling post-office.&nbsp; But in compliment
to the presence of the Premier in the neighbourhood, the train,
instead of slackening speed only, stopped altogether, in order
that the Premier&rsquo;s trusty and confidential messenger <!--
page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>might deliver the important box into my own hands, that
its perfect safety might be ensured.&nbsp; I had an undefined
suspicion that some person was also employed to accompany the
train up to London, for three or four times I had met with a
foreign-looking gentleman at Euston-square, standing at the door
of the carriage nearest the post-office van, and eyeing the heavy
bags as they were transferred from my care to the custody of the
officials from the General Post-office.&nbsp; But though I felt
amused and somewhat nettled at this needless precaution, I took
no further notice of the man, except to observe that he had the
swarthy aspect of a foreigner, and that he kept his face well
away from the light of the lamps.&nbsp; Except for these things,
and after the first time or two, the Premier&rsquo;s despatch-box
interested me no more than any other part of my charge.&nbsp; My
work had been doubly monotonous for some time past, and I began
to think it time to get up some little entertainment with my
unknown friends, the Cliftons.&nbsp; I was just thinking of it as
the train stopped at the station about a mile from the town where
they lived, and their postman, a gruff matter-of-fact
fellow&mdash;you could see it in every line of his face&mdash;put
in the letter-bags, and with them a letter addressed to me.&nbsp;
It was in an official envelope, &ldquo;On Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Service,&rdquo; and the seal was an official seal.&nbsp; On <!--
page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>the folded paper inside it (folded officially also) I
read the following order: &ldquo;Mr. Wilcox is requested to
permit the bearer, the daughter of the postmaster at Eaton, to
see the working of the railway post-office during the
up-journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writing I knew well as being that of
one of the surveyor&rsquo;s clerks, and the signature was Mr.
Huntingdon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The bearer of the order presented
herself at the door, the snorting of the engine gave notice of
the instant departure of the train, I held out my hand, the young
lady sprang lightly and deftly into the van, and we were off
again on our midnight journey.</p>
<p>She was a small slight creature, one of those slender little
girls one never thinks of as being a woman, dressed neatly and
plainly in a dark dress, with a veil hanging a little over her
face and tied under her chin: the most noticeable thing about her
appearance being a great mass of light hair, almost yellow, which
had got loose in some way, and fell down her neck in thick wavy
tresses.&nbsp; She had a free pleasant way about her, not in the
least bold or forward, which in a minute or two made her presence
seem the most natural thing in the world.&nbsp; As she stood
beside me before the row of boxes into which I was sorting my
letters, she asked questions and I answered as if it were quite
an every-day occurrence for us to be travelling up together in
the night mail <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>to Euston-square station.&nbsp; I
blamed myself for an idiot that I had not sooner made an
opportunity for visiting my unknown friends at Eaton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I said, putting down the letter-bill from
their own office before her, &ldquo;may I ask which of the
signatures I know so well, is yours?&nbsp; Is it A. Clifton, or
M. Clifton, or S. Clifton?&rdquo;&nbsp; She hesitated a little,
and blushed, and lifted up her frank childlike eyes to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am A. Clifton,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your name?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne;&rdquo; then, as if anxious to give some
explanation to me of her present position, she added, &ldquo;I
was going up to London on a visit, and I thought it would be so
nice to travel in the post-office to see how the work was done,
and Mr. Huntingdon came to survey our office, and he said he
would send me an order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt somewhat surprised, for a stricter martinet than Mr.
Huntingdon did not breathe; but I glanced down at the small
innocent face at my side, and cordially approved of his departure
from ordinary rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know you would travel with me?&rdquo; I asked,
in a lower voice; for Tom Morville, my junior, was at my other
elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I should travel with Mr. Wilcox,&rdquo; <!--
page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>she answered, with a smile that made all my nerves
tingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not written me a word for ages,&rdquo; said I,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better not talk, or you&rsquo;ll be making
mistakes,&rdquo; she replied, in an arch tone.&nbsp; It was quite
true; for, a sudden confusion coming over me, I was sorting the
letters at random.</p>
<p>We were just then approaching the small station where the
letter-bag from the great house was taken up.&nbsp; The engine
was slackening speed.&nbsp; Miss Clifton manifested some natural
and becoming diffidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would look so odd,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to any
one on the platform, to see a girl in the post-office van!&nbsp;
And they couldn&rsquo;t know I was a postmaster&rsquo;s daughter,
and had an order from Mr. Huntingdon.&nbsp; Is there no dark
corner to shelter me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must explain to you in a word or two the construction of the
van, which was much less efficiently fitted up than the
travelling post-offices of the present day.&nbsp; It was a
reversible van, with a door at each right-hand corner.&nbsp; At
each door the letter-boxes were so arranged as to form a kind of
screen about two feet in width, which prevented people from
seeing all over the carriage at once.&nbsp; Thus the door at the
far end of the van, the one not in use at the time, was thrown
into deep shadow, and <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>the screen before it turned it into
a small niche, where a slight little person like Miss Clifton was
very well concealed from curious eyes.&nbsp; Before the train
came within the light from the lamps on the platform, she
ensconced herself in this shelter.&nbsp; No one but I could see
her laughing face, as she stood there leaning cautiously forward
with her finger pressed upon her rosy lips, peeping at the
messenger who delivered into my own hands the Premier&rsquo;s
despatch-box, while Tom Morville received the letter-bag of the
great house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; I said, when we were again in motion, and
she had emerged from her concealment, &ldquo;this is the
Premier&rsquo;s despatch-box, going back to the Secretary of
State.&nbsp; There are some state secrets for you, and ladies are
fond of secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know nothing about politics,&rdquo; she answered,
indifferently, &ldquo;and we have had that box through our office
a time or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever notice this mark upon it,&rdquo; I
asked&mdash;&ldquo;a heart with a dagger through it?&rdquo; and
bending down my face to hers, I added a certain spooney remark,
which I do not care to repeat.&nbsp; Miss Clifton tossed her
little head, and pouted her lips; but she took the box out of my
hands, and carried it to the lamp nearest the further end of the
van, after which she put it down upon the counter close beside
the screen, and I thought no more about it.&nbsp; The <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>midnight ride was entertaining in the extreme, for the
girl was full of young life and sauciness and merry humour.&nbsp;
I can safely aver that I have never been to an evening&rsquo;s
so-called entertainment which, to me, was half so
enjoyable.&nbsp; It added also to the zest and keen edge of the
enjoyment to see her hasten to hide herself whenever I told her
we were going to stop to take up the mails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had passed Watford, the last station at which we
stopped, before I became alive to the recollection that our work
was terribly behindhand.&nbsp; Miss Clifton also became grave,
and sat at the end of the counter very quiet and subdued, as if
her frolic were over, and it was possible she might find
something to repent of in it.&nbsp; I had told her we should stop
no more until we reached Euston-square station, but to my
surprise I felt our speed decreasing, and our train coming to a
standstill.&nbsp; I looked out and called to the guard in the van
behind, who told me he supposed there was something on the line
before us, and that we should go on in a minute or two.&nbsp; I
turned my head, and gave this information to my fellow-clerk and
Miss Clifton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where we are?&rdquo; she asked, in a
frightened tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Camden-town,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; She sprang
hastily from her seat, and came towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am close to my friend&rsquo;s house here,&rdquo; she
<!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>said, &ldquo;so it is a lucky thing for me.&nbsp; It is
not five minutes&rsquo; walk from the station.&nbsp; I will say
good-bye to you now, Mr. Wilcox, and I thank you a thousand times
for your kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed flurried, and she held out both her little hands to
me in an appealing kind of way, as if she were afraid of my
detaining her against her will.&nbsp; I took them both into mine,
pressing them with rather more ardour than was quite
necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like you to go alone at this hour,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;but there is no help for it.&nbsp; It has been a
delightful time to me.&nbsp; Will you allow me to call upon you
to-morrow morning early, for I leave London at 10.30; or on
Wednesday, when I shall be in town again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; she answered, hanging her head, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write and tell mamma how kind
you have been, and, and&mdash;but I must go, Mr.
Wilcox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like your going alone,&rdquo; I
repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! I know the way perfectly,&rdquo; she said, in the
same flurried manner, &ldquo;perfectly, thank you.&nbsp; And it
is close at hand.&nbsp; Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She jumped lightly out of the carriage, and the train started
on again at the same instant.&nbsp; We were busy enough, as you
may suppose.&nbsp; In five minutes more we should be in
Euston-square, and there was nearly fifteen minutes <!-- page
165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>work still to be done.&nbsp; Spite of the enjoyment he
had afforded me, I mentally anathematised Mr. Huntingdon and his
departure from ordinary rules, and, thrusting Miss Clifton
forcibly out of my thoughts, I set to work with a will, gathered
up the registered letters for London, tied them into a bundle
with the paper bill, and then turned to the corner of the counter
for the despatch-box.</p>
<p>You have guessed already my cursed misfortune.&nbsp; The
Premier&rsquo;s despatch-box was not there.&nbsp; For the first
minute or so I was in nowise alarmed, and merely looked round,
upon the floor, under the bags, into the boxes, into any place
into which it could have fallen or been deposited.&nbsp; We
reached Euston-square while I was still searching, and losing
more and more of my composure every instant.&nbsp; Tom Morville
joined me in my quest, and felt every bag which had been made up
and sealed.&nbsp; The box was no small article which could go
into little compass; it was certainly twelve inches long, and
more than that in girth.&nbsp; But it turned up nowhere.&nbsp; I
never felt nearer fainting than at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could Miss Clifton have carried it off?&rdquo;
suggested Tom Morville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, indignantly but thoughtfully,
&ldquo;she couldn&rsquo;t have carried off such a bulky thing as
that, without our seeing it.&nbsp; It would not go into one of
our pockets, Tom, and she <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>wore a
tight-fitting jacket that would not conceal anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she can&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; assented Tom;
&ldquo;then it must be somewhere about.&rdquo;&nbsp; We searched
again and again, turning over everything in the van, but without
success.&nbsp; The Premier&rsquo;s despatch-box was gone; and all
we could do at first was to stand and stare at one another.&nbsp;
Our trance of blank dismay was of short duration, for the van was
assailed by the postmen from St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand, who
were waiting for our charge.&nbsp; In a stupor of bewilderment we
completed our work, and delivered up the mails; then, once more
we confronted one another with pale faces, frightened out of our
seven senses.&nbsp; All the scrapes we had ever been in (and we
had had our usual share of errors and blunders) faded into utter
insignificance compared with this.&nbsp; My eye fell upon Mr.
Huntingdon&rsquo;s order lying among some scraps of waste paper
on the floor, and I picked it up, and put it carefully, with its
official envelope, into my pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here,&rdquo; said Tom.&nbsp; The
porters were looking in inquisitively; we were seldom so long in
quitting oar empty van.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, a sudden gleam of sense darting
across the blank bewilderment of my brain; &ldquo;no, we must go
to head-quarters at <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>once, and make a clean breast of
it.&nbsp; This is no private business, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made one more ineffectual search, and then we hailed a cab
and drove as hard as we could to the General Post-office.&nbsp;
The secretary of the Post-office was not there, of course, but we
obtained the address of his residence in one of the suburbs, four
or five miles from the City, and we told no one of our
misfortune, my idea being that the fewer who were made acquainted
with the loss the better.&nbsp; My judgment was in the right
there.</p>
<p>We had to knock up the household of the secretary&mdash;a
formidable personage with whom I had never been brought into
contact before&mdash;and in a short time we were holding a
strictly private and confidential interview with him, by the
glimmer of a solitary candle, just serving to light up his severe
face, which changed its expression several times as I narrated
the calamity.&nbsp; It was too stupendous for rebuke, and I
fancied his eyes softened with something like commiseration as he
gazed upon us.&nbsp; After a short interval of deliberation, he
announced his intention of accompanying us to the residence of
the Secretary of State; and in a few minutes we were driving back
again to the opposite extremity of London.&nbsp; It was not far
off the hour for the morning delivery of letters when we reached
our destination; but the atmosphere was yellow with <!-- page
168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>fog, and we could see nothing as we passed along in
almost utter silence, for neither of us ventured to speak, and
the secretary only made a brief remark now and then.&nbsp; We
drove up to some dwelling enveloped in fog, and we were left in
the cab for nearly half an hour, while our secretary went
in.&nbsp; At the end of that time we were summoned to an
apartment where there was seated at a large desk a small spare
man, with a great head, and eyes deeply sunk under the
brows.&nbsp; There was no form of introduction, of course, and we
could only guess who he might be; but we were requested to repeat
our statement, and a few shrewd questions were put to us by the
stranger.&nbsp; We were eager to put him in possession of
everything we knew, but that was little beyond the fact that the
despatch-box was lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young person must have taken it,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could not, sir,&rdquo; I answered, positively, but
deferentially.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wore the tightest-fitting pelisse
I ever saw, and she gave me both her hands when she said
good-bye.&nbsp; She could not possibly have it concealed about
her.&nbsp; It would not go into my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she come to travel up with you in the van,
sir?&rdquo; he asked severely.</p>
<p>I gave him for answer the order signed by Mr.
Huntingdon.&nbsp; He and our secretary scanned it closely.</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&ldquo;It is Huntingdon&rsquo;s signature without
doubt,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;I could swear to it
anywhere.&nbsp; This is an extraordinary circumstance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary circumstance.&nbsp; The two retired
into an adjoining room, where they stayed for another half-hour,
and when they returned to us their faces still bore an aspect of
grave perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wilcox and Mr. Morville,&rdquo; said our secretary,
&ldquo;it is expedient that this affair should be kept inviolably
secret.&nbsp; You must even be careful not to hint that you hold
any secret.&nbsp; You did well not to announce your loss at the
Post-office, and I shall cause it to be understood that you had
instructions to take the despatch-box direct to its
destination.&nbsp; Your business now is to find the young woman,
and return with her not later than six o&rsquo;clock this
afternoon to my office at the General Post-office.&nbsp; What
other steps we think it requisite to take, you need know nothing
about; the less you know, the better for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another gleam of commiseration in his official eye made our
hearts sink within us.&nbsp; We departed promptly, and, with that
instinct of wisdom which at times dictates infallibly what course
we should pursue, we decided our line of action.&nbsp; Tom
Morville was to go down to Camden-town, and inquire at every
house for Miss Clifton, while I&mdash;there would <!-- page
170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>be
just time for it&mdash;was to run down to Eaton by train and
obtain her exact address from her parents.&nbsp; We agreed to
meet at the General Post-office at half-past five, if I could
possibly reach it by that time; but in any case Tom was to report
himself to the secretary and account for my absence.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the station at Eaton, I found that I had
only forty-five minutes before the up train went by.&nbsp; The
town was nearly a mile away, but I made all the haste I could to
reach it.&nbsp; I was not surprised to find the post-office in
connexion with a bookseller&rsquo;s shop, and I saw a pleasant
elderly lady seated behind the counter, while a tall dark-haired
girl was sitting at some work a little out of sight.&nbsp; I
introduced myself at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Frank Wilcox, of the railway post-office, and I
have just run down to Eaton to obtain some information from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; We know you well by name,&rdquo; was
the reply, given in a cordial manner, which was particularly
pleasant to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be so good as give me the address of Miss Anne
Clifton in Camden-town?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Anne Clifton?&rdquo; ejaculated the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Your daughter, I presume.&nbsp; Who went up
to London last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no daughter Anne,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am
Anne Clifton, and my daughters are named <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Mary and
Susan.&nbsp; This is my daughter Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall dark-haired girl had left her seat, and now stood
beside her mother.&nbsp; Certainly she was very unlike the small
golden-haired coquette who had travelled up to London with me as
Anne Clifton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I said, scarcely able to speak, &ldquo;is
your other daughter a slender little creature, exactly the
reverse of this young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, laughing; &ldquo;Susan is both
taller and darker than Mary.&nbsp; Call Susan, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few seconds Miss Susan made her appearance, and I had the
three before me&mdash;A. Clifton, S. Clifton, and M.
Clifton.&nbsp; There was no other girl in the family; and when I
described the young lady who had travelled under their name, they
could not think of any one in the town&mdash;it was a small
one&mdash;who answered my description, or who had gone on a visit
to London.&nbsp; I had no time to spare, and I hurried back to
the station, just catching the train as it left the
platform.&nbsp; At the appointed hour I met Morville at the
General Post-office, and threading the long passages of the
secretary&rsquo;s offices, we at length found ourselves anxiously
waiting in an ante-room, until we were called into his
presence.&nbsp; Morville had discovered nothing, except that the
porters and policemen at Camden-town station had <!-- page
172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>seen a young lady pass out last night, attended by a
swarthy man who looked like a foreigner, and carried a small
black portmanteau.</p>
<p>I scarcely know how long we waited; it might have been years,
for I was conscious of an ever-increasing difficulty in
commanding my thoughts, or fixing them upon the subject which had
engrossed them all day.&nbsp; I had not tasted food for
twenty-four hours, nor closed my eyes for thirty-six, while,
during the whole of the time, my nervous system had been on full
strain.</p>
<p>Presently, the summons came, and I was ushered, first, into
the inner apartment.&nbsp; There sat five gentlemen round a
table, which was strewed with a number of documents.&nbsp; There
were the Secretary of State, whom we had seen in the morning, our
secretary, and Mr. Huntingdon; the fourth was a fine-looking man,
whom I afterwards knew to be the Premier; the fifth I recognised
as our great chief, the Postmaster-General.&nbsp; It was an
august assemblage to me, and I bowed low; but my head was dizzy,
and my throat parched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wilcox,&rdquo; said our secretary, &ldquo;you will
tell these gentlemen again, the circumstances of the loss you
reported to me this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laid my hand upon the back of a chair to steady myself, and
went through the narration for the third time, passing over
sundry remarks made by myself to the young lady.&nbsp; That <!--
page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>done, I added the account of my expedition to Eaton,
and the certainty at which I had arrived that my fellow-traveller
was not the person she represented herself to be.&nbsp; After
which, I inquired with indescribable anxiety if Mr.
Huntingdon&rsquo;s order were a forgery?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell, Mr. Wilcox,&rdquo; said that gentleman,
taking the order into his hands, and regarding it with an air of
extreme perplexity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could have sworn it was mine,
had it been attached to any other document.&nbsp; I think
Forbes&rsquo;s handwriting is not so well imitated.&nbsp; But it
is the very ink I use, and mine is a peculiar
signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very peculiar and old-fashioned signature, with a
flourish underneath it not unlike a whip-handle, with the lash
caught round it in the middle; but that did not make it the more
difficult to forge, as I humbly suggested.&nbsp; Mr. Huntingdon
wrote his name upon a paper, and two or three of the gentlemen
tried to imitate the flourish, but vainly.&nbsp; They gave it up
with a smile upon their grave faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been careful not to let a hint of this matter
drop from you, Mr. Wilcox?&rdquo; said the
Postmaster-General.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a syllable, my lord,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is imperatively necessary that the secret should be
kept.&nbsp; You would be removed from the temptation of telling
it, if you had an <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>appointment in some office
abroad.&nbsp; The packet-agency at Alexandria is vacant, and I
will have you appointed to it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be a good advance from my present situation, and
would doubtless prove a stepping-stone to other and better
appointments; but I had a mother living at Fazeley, bedridden and
paralytic, who had no pleasure in existence except having me to
dwell under the same roof with her.&nbsp; My head was growing
more and more dizzy, and a strange vagueness was creeping over
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I muttered, &ldquo;I have a bedridden
mother whom I cannot leave.&nbsp; I was not to blame,
gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; I fancied there was a stir and movement
at the table, but my eyes were dim, and in another second I had
lost consciousness.</p>
<p>When I came to myself, in two or three minutes, I found that
Mr. Huntingdon was kneeling on the floor beside me, supporting my
head, while our secretary held a glass of wine to my lips.&nbsp;
I rallied as quickly as possible, and staggered to my feet; but
the two gentlemen placed me in the chair against which I had been
leaning, and insisted upon my finishing the wine before I tried
to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not tasted food all day,&rdquo; I said,
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my good fellow, you shall go home
immediately,&rdquo; said the Postmaster-General; <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&ldquo;but be on your guard!&nbsp; Not a word of this
must escape you.&nbsp; Are you a married man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; he added, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can keep a secret from your mother, I dare say.&nbsp;
We rely upon your honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary then rang a bell, and I was committed to the
charge of the messenger who answered it; and in a few minutes I
was being conveyed in a cab to my London lodgings.&nbsp; A week
afterwards, Tom Morville was sent out to a post-office in Canada,
where he settled down, married, and is still living, perfectly
satisfied with his position, as he occasionally informs me by
letter.&nbsp; For myself, I remained as I desired, in my old post
as travelling-clerk until the death of my mother, which occurred
some ten or twelve months afterwards.&nbsp; I was then promoted
to an appointment as a clerk in charge, upon the first
vacancy.</p>
<p>The business of the clerks in charge is to take possession of
any post-office in the kingdom, upon the death or resignation of
the postmaster, or when circumstances of suspicion cause his
suspension from office.&nbsp; My new duties carried me three or
four times into Mr. Huntingdon&rsquo;s district.&nbsp; Though
that gentleman and I never exchanged a word with regard to the
mysterious loss in which we had both had an innocent share, he
distinguished <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>me with peculiar favour, and more
than once invited me to visit him at his own house.&nbsp; He
lived alone, having but one daughter, who had married, somewhat
against his will, one of his clerks: the Mr. Forbes whose
handwriting had been so successfully imitated in the official
order presented to me by the self-styled Miss Anne Clifton.&nbsp;
(By the way, I may here mention, though it has nothing to do with
my story, that my acquaintance with the Cliftons had ripened into
an intimacy, which resulted in my engagement and marriage to
Mary.)</p>
<p>It would be beside my purpose to specify the precise number of
years which elapsed before I was once again summoned to the
secretary&rsquo;s private apartment, where I found him closeted
with Mr. Huntingdon.&nbsp; Mr. Huntingdon shook hands with
unofficial cordiality; and then the secretary proceeded to state
the business on hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wilcox, you remember our offer to place you in
office in Alexandria?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a troublesome office,&rdquo; he continued,
almost pettishly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We sent out Mr. Forbes only six
months ago, on account of his health, which required a warmer
climate, and now his medical man reports that his life is not
worth three weeks&rsquo; purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon Mr. Huntingdon&rsquo;s face there rested <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>an
expression of profound anxiety; and as the secretary paused he
addressed himself to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wilcox,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been
soliciting, as a personal favour, that you should be sent out to
take charge of the packet-agency, in order that my daughter may
have some one at hand to befriend her, and manage her business
affairs for her.&nbsp; You are not personally acquainted with
her, but I know I can trust her with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may, Mr. Huntingdon,&rdquo; I said, warmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will do anything I can to aid Mrs. Forbes.&nbsp; When do
you wish me to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon can you be ready?&rdquo; was the
rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not married then, and I anticipated no delay in setting
off.&nbsp; Nor was there any.&nbsp; I travelled with the overland
mail through France to Marseilles, embarked in a vessel for
Alexandria, and in a few days from the time I first heard of my
destination set foot in the office there.&nbsp; All the postal
arrangements had fallen into considerable irregularity and
confusion; for, as I was informed immediately on my arrival, Mr.
Forbes had been in a dying condition for the last week, and of
course the absence of a master had borne the usual results.&nbsp;
I took formal possession of the office, and then, conducted by
one of the clerks, I <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>proceeded to the dwelling of the
unfortunate postmaster and his no less unfortunate wife.&nbsp; It
would be out of place in this narrative to indulge in any
traveller&rsquo;s tales about the strange place where I was so
unexpectedly located.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that the darkened
sultry room into which I was shown, on inquiring for Mrs. Forbes,
was bare of furniture, and destitute of all those little tokens
of refinement and taste which make our English parlours so
pleasant to the eye.&nbsp; There was, however, a piano in one of
the dark corners of the room, open, and with a sheet of music on
it.&nbsp; While I waited for Mrs. Forbes&rsquo;s appearance, I
strolled idly up to the piano to see what music it might
be.&nbsp; The next moment my eye fell upon an antique red morocco
workbox standing on the top of the piano&mdash;a workbox
evidently, for the lid was not closely shut, and a few threads of
silk and cotton were hanging out of it.&nbsp; In a kind of
dream&mdash;for it was difficult to believe that the occurrence
was a fact&mdash;I carried the box to the darkened window, and
there, plain in my sight, was the device scratched upon the
leather: the revolutionary symbol of a heart with a dagger
through it.&nbsp; I had found the Premier&rsquo;s despatch-box in
the parlour of the packet-agent of Alexandria!</p>
<p>I stood for some minutes with that dream-like feeling upon me,
gazing at the box in the <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>dim obscure
light.&nbsp; It could <i>not</i> be real!&nbsp; My fancy must be
playing a trick upon me!&nbsp; But the sound of a light
step&mdash;for, light as it was, I heard it distinctly as it
approached the room&mdash;broke my trance, and I hastened to
replace the box on the piano, and to stoop down as if examining
the music before the door opened.&nbsp; I had not sent in my name
to Mrs. Forbes, for I did not suppose that she was acquainted
with it, nor could she see me distinctly, as I stood in the
gloom.&nbsp; But I could see her.&nbsp; She had the slight
slender figure, the childlike face, and the fair hair of Miss
Anne Clifton.&nbsp; She came quickly across the room, holding out
both her hands in a childish appealing manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; she wailed, in a tone that went straight to
my heart, &ldquo;he is dead!&nbsp; He has just died!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no time then to speak about the red morocco
workbox.&nbsp; This little childish creature, who did not look a
day older than when I had last seen her in my travelling
post-office, was a widow in a strange land, far away from any
friend save myself.&nbsp; I had brought her a letter from her
father.&nbsp; The first duties that devolved upon me were those
of her husband&rsquo;s interment, which had to take place
immediately.&nbsp; Three or four weeks elapsed before I could,
with any humanity, enter upon the investigation of her mysterious
complicity in the <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>daring theft practised on the
government and the post-office.</p>
<p>I did not see the despatch-box again.&nbsp; In the midst of
her new and vehement grief, Mrs. Forbes had the precaution to
remove it before I was ushered again into the room where I had
discovered it.&nbsp; I was at some trouble to hit upon any plan
by which to gain a second sight of it; but I was resolved that
Mrs. Forbes should not leave Alexandria without giving me a full
explanation.&nbsp; We were waiting for remittances and
instructions from England, and in the meantime the violence of
her grief abated, and she recovered a good share of her old
buoyancy and loveliness, which had so delighted me on my first
acquaintance with her.&nbsp; As her demands upon my sympathy
weakened, my curiosity grew stronger, and at last mastered
me.&nbsp; I carried with me a netted purse which required
mending, and I asked her to catch up the broken meshes while I
waited for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell your maid to bring your workbox,&rdquo; I
said, going to the door and calling the servant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your mistress has a red morocco workbox,&rdquo; I said to
her, as she answered my summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her bedroom,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Forbes wishes it brought here.&rdquo;&nbsp; I <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>turned back into the room.&nbsp; Mrs. Forbes had gone
deadly pale, but her eyes looked sullen, and her teeth were
clenched under her lips with an expression of stubbornness.&nbsp;
The maid brought the workbox.&nbsp; I walked, with it in my
hands, up to the sofa where she was seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember this mark?&rdquo; I asked; &ldquo;I think
neither of us can ever forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer by word, but there was a very intelligent
gleam in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I continued, softly, &ldquo;I promised your
father to befriend you, and I am not a man to forget a
promise.&nbsp; But you must tell me the whole simple
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was compelled to reason with her, and to urge her for some
time.&nbsp; I confess I went so far as to remind her that there
was an English consul at Alexandria, to whom I could
resort.&nbsp; At last she opened her stubborn lips, and the whole
story came out, mingled with sobs and showers of tears.</p>
<p>She had been in love with Alfred, she said, and they were too
poor to marry, and papa would not hear of such a thing.&nbsp; She
was always in want of money, she was kept so short; and they
promised to give her such a great sum&mdash;a vast sum&mdash;five
hundred pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who bribed you?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>A foreign gentleman whom she had met in London, called
Monsieur Bonnard.&nbsp; It was a <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>French
name, but she was not sure that he was a Frenchman.&nbsp; He
talked to her about her father being a surveyor in the
post-office, and asked her a great number of questions.&nbsp; A
few weeks after, she met him in their own town by accident, she
and Mr. Forbes; and Alfred had a long private talk with him, and
they came to her, and told her she could help them very
much.&nbsp; They asked her if she could be brave enough to carry
off a little red box out of the travelling post-office,
containing nothing but papers.&nbsp; After a while she
consented.&nbsp; When she had confessed so much under compulsion,
Mrs. Forbes seemed to take a pleasure in the narrative, and went
on fluently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We required papa&rsquo;s signature to the order, and we
did not know how to get it.&nbsp; Luckily he had a fit of the
gout, and was very peevish; and I had to read over a lot of
official papers to him, and then he signed them.&nbsp; One of the
papers I read twice, and slipped the order into its place after
the second reading.&nbsp; I thought I should have died with
fright; but just then he was in great pain, and glad to get his
work over.&nbsp; I made an excuse that I was going to visit my
aunt at Beckby, but instead of going there direct, we contrived
to be at the station at Eaton a minute or two before the mail
train came up.&nbsp; I kept outside the station door till we
heard the whistle, and just then <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the postman
came running down the road, and I followed him straight through
the booking-office, and asked him to give you the order, which I
put into his hand.&nbsp; He scarcely saw me.&nbsp; I just caught
a glimpse of Monsieur Bonnard&rsquo;s face through the window of
the compartment next the van, when Alfred had gone.&nbsp; They
had promised me that the train should stop at Camden-town, if I
could only keep your attention engaged until then.&nbsp; You know
how I succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you dispose of the box?&rdquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You could not have concealed it about you;
that I am sure of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;nothing was easier.&nbsp;
Monsieur Bonnard had described the van to me, and you remember I
put the box down at the end of the counter, close to the corner
where I hid myself at every station.&nbsp; There was a door with
a window in it, and I asked if I might have the window open, as
the van was too warm for me.&nbsp; I believe Monsieur Bonnard
could have taken it from me by only leaning through his window,
but he preferred stepping out, and taking it from my hand, just
as the train was leaving Watford&mdash;on the far side of the
carriages, you understand.&nbsp; It was the last station, and the
train came to a stand at Camden-town.&nbsp; After all, the box
was not out of your sight more than twenty minutes before you
missed it.&nbsp; Monsieur Bonnard and <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>I hurried
out of the station, and Alfred followed us.&nbsp; The box was
forced open&mdash;the lock has never been mended, for it was a
peculiar one&mdash;and Monsieur Bonnard took possession of the
papers.&nbsp; He left the box with me, after putting inside it a
roll of notes.&nbsp; Alfred and I were married next morning, and
I went back to my aunt&rsquo;s; but we did not tell papa of our
marriage for three or four months.&nbsp; That is the story of my
red morocco workbox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled with the provoking mirthfulness of a mischievous
child.&nbsp; There was one point still, on which my curiosity was
unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know what the despatches were about?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no!&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I never understood
politics in the least.&nbsp; I knew nothing about them.&nbsp;
Monsieur did not say a word; he did not even look at the papers
while we were by.&nbsp; I would never, never, have taken a
registered letter, or anything with money in it, you know.&nbsp;
But all those papers could be written again quite easily.&nbsp;
You must not think me a thief, Mr. Wilcox; there was nothing
worth money among the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were worth five hundred pounds to you,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever see Bonnard again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never again,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He said
he <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>was going to return to his native country.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think Bonnard was his real name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most likely not, I thought; but I said no more to Mrs.
Forbes.&nbsp; Once again I was involved in a great perplexity
about this affair.&nbsp; It was clearly my duty to report the
discovery at head-quarters, but I shrank from doing so.&nbsp; One
of the chief culprits was already gone to another judgment than
that of man; several years had obliterated all traces of Monsieur
Bonnard; and the only victim of justice would be this poor little
dupe of the two greater criminals.&nbsp; At last I came to the
conclusion to send the whole of the particulars to Mr. Huntingdon
himself; and I wrote them to him, without remark or comment.</p>
<p>The answer that came to Mrs. Forbes and me in Alexandria was
the announcement of Mr. Huntingdon&rsquo;s sudden death of some
disease of the heart, on the day which I calculated would put him
in possession of my communication.&nbsp; Mrs. Forbes was again
overwhelmed with apparently heartrending sorrow and
remorse.&nbsp; The income left to her was something less than one
hundred pounds a year.&nbsp; The secretary of the post-office,
who had been a personal friend of the deceased gentleman, was his
sole executor; and I received a letter from him, containing one
for Mrs. Forbes, which recommended her, in terms not to be
misunderstood, to fix upon <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>some
residence abroad, and not to return to England.&nbsp; She fancied
she would like the seclusion and quiet of a convent; and I made
arrangements for her to enter one in Malta, where she would still
be under British protection.&nbsp; I left Alexandria myself on
the arrival of another packet-agent; and on my return to London I
had a private interview with the secretary.&nbsp; I found that
there was no need to inform him of the circumstances I have
related to you, as he had taken possession of all Mr.
Huntingdon&rsquo;s papers.&nbsp; In consideration of his ancient
friendship, and of the escape of those who most merited
punishment, he had come to the conclusion that it was quite as
well to let bygones be bygones.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the interview I delivered a message which
Mrs. Forbes had emphatically entrusted to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Forbes wished me to impress upon your mind,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;that neither she nor Mr. Forbes would have been
guilty of this misdemeanour if they had not been very much in
love with one another, and very much in want of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the secretary, with a smile,
&ldquo;if Cleopatra&rsquo;s nose had been shorter, the fate of
the world would have been different!&rdquo;</p>

BRANCH LINE<br />
THE ENGINEER</h2>
<p>His name, sir, was Matthew Price; mine is Benjamin
Hardy.&nbsp; We were born within a few days of each other; bred
up in the same village; taught at the same school.&nbsp; I cannot
remember the time when we were not close friends.&nbsp; Even as
boys, we never knew what it was to quarrel.&nbsp; We had not a
thought, we had not a possession, that was not in common.&nbsp;
We would have stood by each other, fearlessly, to the
death.&nbsp; It was such a friendship as one reads about
sometimes in books: fast and firm as the great Tors upon our
native moorlands, true as the sun in the heavens.</p>
<p>The name of our village was Chadleigh.&nbsp; Lifted high above
the pasture flats which stretched away at our feet like a
measureless green lake and melted into mist on the furthest
horizon, it nestled, a tiny stone-built hamlet, in a sheltered
hollow about midway between the plain and the plateau.&nbsp;
Above us, rising ridge beyond ridge, slope beyond slope, <!--
page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>spread the mountainous moor-country, bare and bleak for
the most part, with here and there a patch of cultivated field or
hardy plantation, and crowned highest of all with masses of huge
grey crag, abrupt, isolated, hoary, and older than the
deluge.&nbsp; These were the Tors&mdash;Druids&rsquo; Tor,
King&rsquo;s Tor, Castle Tor, and the like; sacred places, as I
have heard, in the ancient time, where crownings, burnings, human
sacrifices, and all kinds of bloody heathen rites were
performed.&nbsp; Bones, too, had been found there, and
arrow-heads, and ornaments of gold and glass.&nbsp; I had a vague
awe of the Tors in those boyish days, and would not have gone
near them after dark for the heaviest bribe.</p>
<p>I have said that we were born in the same village.&nbsp; He
was the son of a small farmer, named William Price, and the
eldest of a family of seven; I was the only child of Ephraim
Hardy, the Chadleigh blacksmith&mdash;a well-known man in those
parts, whose memory is not forgotten to this day.&nbsp; Just so
far as a farmer is supposed to be a bigger man than a blacksmith,
Mat&rsquo;s father might be said to have a better standing than
mine; but William Price, with his small holding and his seven
boys, was, in fact, as poor as many a day-labourer; whilst the
blacksmith, well-to-do, bustling, popular, and open-handed, was a
person of some importance in the place.&nbsp; All <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>this, however, had nothing to do with Mat and
myself.&nbsp; It never occurred to either of us that his jacket
was out at elbows, or that our mutual funds came altogether from
my pocket.&nbsp; It was enough for us that we sat on the same
school-bench, conned our tasks from the same primer, fought each
other&rsquo;s battles, screened each other&rsquo;s faults,
fished, nutted, played truant, robbed orchards and birds&rsquo;
nests together, and spent every half-hour, authorised or stolen,
in each other&rsquo;s society.&nbsp; It was a happy time; but it
could not go on for ever.&nbsp; My father, being prosperous,
resolved to put me forward in the world.&nbsp; I must know more,
and do better, than himself.&nbsp; The forge was not good enough,
the little world of Chadleigh not wide enough, for me.&nbsp; Thus
it happened that I was still swinging the satchel when Mat was
whistling at the plough, and that at last, when my future course
was shaped out, we were separated, as it then seemed to us, for
life.&nbsp; For, blacksmith&rsquo;s son as I was, furnace and
forge, in some form or other, pleased me best, and I chose to be
a working engineer.&nbsp; So my father by-and-by apprenticed me
to a Birmingham iron-master; and, having bidden farewell to Mat,
and Chadleigh, and the grey old Tors in the shadow of which I had
spent all the days of my life, I turned my face northward, and
went over into &ldquo;the Black Country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>I am not going to dwell on this part of my story.&nbsp;
How I worked out the term of my apprenticeship; how, when I had
served my full time and become a skilled workman, I took Mat from
the plough and brought him over to the Black Country, sharing
with him lodging, wages, experience&mdash;all, in short, that I
had to give; how he, naturally quick to learn and brimful of
quiet energy, worked his way up a step at a time, and came
by-and-by to be a &ldquo;first hand&rdquo; in his own department;
how, during all these years of change, and trial, and effort, the
old boyish affection never wavered or weakened, but went on,
growing with our growth and strengthening with our
strength&mdash;are facts which I need do no more than outline in
this place.</p>
<p>About this time&mdash;it will be remembered that I speak of
the days when Mat and I were on the bright side of
thirty&mdash;it happened that our firm contracted to supply six
first-class locomotives to run on the new line, then in process
of construction, between Turin and Genoa.&nbsp; It was the first
Italian order we had taken.&nbsp; We had had dealings with
France, Holland, Belgium, Germany; but never with Italy.&nbsp;
The connexion, therefore, was new and valuable&mdash;all the more
valuable because our Transalpine neighbours had but lately begun
to lay down the iron roads, and would be safe to need more of our
good English <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>work as they went on.&nbsp; So the
Birmingham firm set themselves to the contract with a will,
lengthened our working hours, increased our wages, took on fresh
hands, and determined, if energy and promptitude could do it, to
place themselves at the head of the Italian labour-market, and
stay there.&nbsp; They deserved and achieved success.&nbsp; The
six locomotives were not only turned out to time, but were
shipped, despatched, and delivered with a promptitude that fairly
amazed our Piedmontese consignee.&nbsp; I was not a little proud,
you may be sure, when I found myself appointed to superintend the
transport of the engines.&nbsp; Being allowed a couple of
assistants, I contrived that Mat should be one of them; and thus
we enjoyed together the first great holiday of our lives.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful change for two Birmingham operatives fresh
from the Black Country.&nbsp; The fairy city, with its crescent
background of Alps; the port crowded with strange shipping; the
marvellous blue sky and bluer sea; the painted houses on the
quays; the quaint cathedral, faced with black and white marble;
the street of jewellers, like an Arabian Nights&rsquo; bazaar;
the street of palaces, with its Moorish court-yards, its
fountains and orange-trees; the women veiled like brides; the
galley-slaves chained two and two; the processions of priests and
friars; the everlasting clangour of bells; the babble of a
strange tongue; the <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>singular lightness and brightness of
the climate&mdash;made, altogether, such a combination of wonders
that we wandered about, the first day, in a kind of bewildered
dream, like children at a fair.&nbsp; Before that week was ended,
being tempted by the beauty of the place and the liberality of
the pay, we had agreed to take service with the Turin and Genoa
Railway Company, and to turn our backs upon Birmingham for
ever.</p>
<p>Then began a new life&mdash;a life so active and healthy, so
steeped in fresh air and sunshine, that we sometimes marvelled
how we could have endured the gloom of the Black Country.&nbsp;
We were constantly up and down the line: now at Genoa, now at
Turin, taking trial trips with the locomotives, and placing our
old experiences at the service of our new employers.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile we made Genoa our headquarters, and hired a
couple of rooms over a small shop in a by-street sloping down to
the quays.&nbsp; Such a busy little street&mdash;so steep and
winding that no vehicles could pass through it, and so narrow
that the sky looked like a mere strip of deep-blue ribbon
overhead!&nbsp; Every house in it, however, was a shop, where the
goods encroached on the footway, or were piled about the door, or
hung like tapestry from the balconies; and all day long, from
dawn to dusk, an incessant stream of passers-by <!-- page
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>poured up and down between the port and the upper
quarter of the city.</p>
<p>Our landlady was the widow of a silver-worker, and lived by
the sale of filigree ornaments, cheap jewellery, combs, fans, and
toys in ivory and jet.&nbsp; She had an only daughter named
Gianetta, who served in the shop, and was simply the most
beautiful woman I ever beheld.&nbsp; Looking back across this
weary chasm of years, and bringing her image before me (as I can
and do) with all the vividness of life, I am unable, even now, to
detect a flaw in her beauty.&nbsp; I do not attempt to describe
her.&nbsp; I do not believe there is a poet living who could find
the words to do it; but I once saw a picture that was somewhat
like her (not half so lovely, but still like her), and, for aught
I know, that picture is still hanging where I last looked at
it&mdash;upon the walls of the Louvre.&nbsp; It represented a
woman with brown eyes and golden hair, looking over her shoulder
into a circular mirror held by a bearded man in the
background.&nbsp; In this man, as I then understood, the artist
had painted his own portrait; in her, the portrait of the woman
he loved.&nbsp; No picture that I ever saw was half so beautiful,
and yet it was not worthy to be named in the same breath with
Gianetta Coneglia.</p>
<p>You may be certain the widow&rsquo;s shop did not want for
customers.&nbsp; All Genoa knew how fair a face was to be seen
behind that dingy little <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>counter;
and Gianetta, flirt as she was, had more lovers than she cared to
remember, even by name.&nbsp; Gentle and simple, rich and poor,
from the red-capped sailor buying his earrings or his amulet, to
the nobleman carelessly purchasing half the filigrees in the
window, she treated them all alike&mdash;encouraged them, laughed
at them, led them on and turned them off at her pleasure.&nbsp;
She had no more heart than a marble statue; as Mat and I
discovered by-and-by, to our bitter cost.</p>
<p>I cannot tell to this day how it came about, or what first led
me to suspect how things were going with us both; but long before
the waning of that autumn a coldness had sprung up between my
friend and myself.&nbsp; It was nothing that could have been put
into words.&nbsp; It was nothing that either of us could have
explained or justified, to save his life.&nbsp; We lodged
together, ate together, worked together, exactly as before; we
even took our long evening&rsquo;s walk together, when the
day&rsquo;s labour was ended; and except, perhaps, that we were
more silent than of old, no mere looker-on could have detected a
shadow of change.&nbsp; Yet there it was, silent and subtle,
widening the gulf between us every day.</p>
<p>It was not his fault.&nbsp; He was too true and gentle-hearted
to have willingly brought about such a state of things between
us.&nbsp; Neither do I believe&mdash;fiery as my nature
is&mdash;that it was <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>mine.&nbsp; It was all
hers&mdash;hers from first to last&mdash;the sin, and the shame,
and the sorrow.</p>
<p>If she had shown a fair and open preference for either of us,
no real harm could have come of it.&nbsp; I would have put any
constraint upon myself, and, Heaven knows! have borne any
suffering, to see Mat really happy.&nbsp; I know that he would
have done the same, and more if he could, for me.&nbsp; But
Gianetta cared not one sou for either.&nbsp; She never meant to
choose between us.&nbsp; It gratified her vanity to divide us; it
amused her to play with us.&nbsp; It would pass my power to tell
how, by a thousand imperceptible shades of coquetry&mdash;by the
lingering of a glance, the substitution of a word, the flitting
of a smile&mdash;she contrived to turn our heads, and torture our
hearts, and lead us on to love her.&nbsp; She deceived us
both.&nbsp; She buoyed us both up with hope; she maddened us with
jealousy; she crushed us with despair.&nbsp; For my part, when I
seemed to wake to a sudden sense of the ruin that was about our
path and I saw how the truest friendship that ever bound two
lives together was drifting on to wreck and ruin, I asked myself
whether any woman in the world was worth what Mat had been to me
and I to him.&nbsp; But this was not often.&nbsp; I was readier
to shut my eyes upon the truth than to face it; and so lived on,
wilfully, in a dream.</p>
<p>Thus the autumn passed away, and winter <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>came&mdash;the strange, treacherous, Genoese winter,
green with olive and ilex, brilliant with sunshine, and bitter
with storm.&nbsp; Still, rivals at heart and friends on the
surface, Mat and I lingered on in our lodging in the Vicolo
Balba.&nbsp; Still Gianetta held us with her fatal wiles and her
still more fatal beauty.&nbsp; At length there came a day when I
felt I could bear the horrible misery and suspense of it no
longer.&nbsp; The sun, I vowed, should not go down before I knew
my sentence.&nbsp; She must choose between us.&nbsp; She must
either take me or let me go.&nbsp; I was reckless.&nbsp; I was
desperate.&nbsp; I was determined to know the worst, or the
best.&nbsp; If the worst, I would at once turn my back upon
Genoa, upon her, upon all the pursuits and purposes of my past
life, and begin the world anew.&nbsp; This I told her,
passionately and sternly, standing before her in the little
parlour at the back of the shop, one bleak December morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Mat whom you care for most,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;tell me so in one word, and I will never trouble you
again.&nbsp; He is better worth your love.&nbsp; I am jealous and
exacting; he is as trusting and unselfish as a woman.&nbsp;
Speak, Gianetta; am I to bid you good-bye for ever and ever, or
am I to write home to my mother in England, bidding her pray to
God to bless the woman who has promised to be my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You plead your friend&rsquo;s cause well,&rdquo; she
<!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>replied, haughtily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Matteo ought to be
grateful.&nbsp; This is more than he ever did for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my answer, for pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I
exclaimed, &ldquo;and let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are free to go or stay, Signor Inglese,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not your jailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you bid me leave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beata Madre! not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me, if I stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed aloud&mdash;such a merry, mocking, musical laugh,
like a chime of silver bells!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask too much,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what you have led me to hope these five or six
months past!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what Matteo says.&nbsp; How tiresome you
both are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Gianetta,&rdquo; I said, passionately, &ldquo;be
serious for one moment!&nbsp; I am a rough fellow, it is
true&mdash;not half good enough or clever enough for you; but I
love you with my whole heart, and an Emperor could do no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I do not
want you to love me less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you cannot wish to make me wretched!&nbsp; Will
you promise me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise nothing,&rdquo; said she, with another burst
of laughter; &ldquo;except that I will not marry
Matteo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except that she would not marry Matteo!&nbsp; <!-- page
198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Only that.&nbsp; Not a word of hope for myself.&nbsp;
Nothing but my friend&rsquo;s condemnation.&nbsp; I might get
comfort, and selfish triumph, and some sort of base assurance out
of that, if I could.&nbsp; And so, to my shame, I did.&nbsp; I
grasped at the vain encouragement, and, fool that I was! let her
put me off again unanswered.&nbsp; From that day, I gave up all
effort at self-control, and let myself drift blindly on&mdash;to
destruction.</p>
<p>At length things became so bad between Mat and myself that it
seemed as if an open rupture must be at hand.&nbsp; We avoided
each other, scarcely exchanged a dozen sentences in a day, and
fell away from all our old familiar habits.&nbsp; At this
time&mdash;I shudder to remember it!&mdash;there were moments
when I felt that I hated him.</p>
<p>Thus, with the trouble deepening and widening between us day
by day, another month or five weeks went by; and February came;
and, with February, the Carnival.&nbsp; They said in Genoa that
it was a particularly dull carnival; and so it must have been;
for, save a flag or two hung out in some of the principal
streets, and a sort of festa look about the women, there were no
special indications of the season.&nbsp; It was, I think, the
second day when, having been on the line all the morning, I
returned to Genoa at dusk, and, to my surprise, found Mat Price
on the platform.&nbsp; <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>He came up
to me, and laid his hand on my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in late,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
been waiting for you three-quarters of an hour.&nbsp; Shall we
dine together to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsive as I am, this evidence of returning good will at
once called up my better feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, Mat,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;shall
we go to Gozzoli&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some
quieter place&mdash;some place where we can talk.&nbsp; I have
something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noticed now that he looked pale and agitated, and an uneasy
sense of apprehension stole upon me.&nbsp; We decided on the
&ldquo;Pescatore,&rdquo; a little out-of-the-way trattoria, down
near the Molo Vecchio.&nbsp; There, in a dingy salon, frequented
chiefly by seamen, and redolent of tobacco, we ordered our simple
dinner.&nbsp; Mat scarcely swallowed a morsel; but, calling
presently for a bottle of Sicilian wine, drank eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mat,&rdquo; I said, as the last dish was placed
on the table, &ldquo;what news have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed that from your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad for you&mdash;bad for me.&nbsp;
Gianetta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of Gianetta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed his hand nervously across his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gianetta is false&mdash;worse than false,&rdquo; he
said, in a hoarse voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;She values an honest <!--
page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>man&rsquo;s heart just as she values a flower for her
hair&mdash;wears it for a day, then throws it aside for
ever.&nbsp; She has cruelly wronged us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&nbsp; Good Heavens, speak out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the worst way that a woman can wrong those who love
her.&nbsp; She has sold herself to the Marchese
Loredano.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blood rushed to my head and face in a burning
torrent.&nbsp; I could scarcely see, and dared not trust myself
to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her going towards the cathedral,&rdquo; he went
on, hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was about three hours ago.&nbsp; I
thought she might be going to confession, so I hung back and
followed her at a distance.&nbsp; When she got inside, however,
she went straight to the back of the pulpit, where this man was
waiting for her.&nbsp; You remember him&mdash;an old man who used
to haunt the shop a month or two back.&nbsp; Well, seeing how
deep in conversation they were, and how they stood close under
the pulpit with their backs towards the church, I fell into a
passion of anger and went straight up the aisle, intending to say
or do something: I scarcely knew what; but, at all events, to
draw her arm through mine, and take her home.&nbsp; When I came
within a few feet, however, and found only a big pillar between
myself and them, I paused.&nbsp; They could not see me, nor I
them; <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>but I could hear their voices
distinctly, and&mdash;and I listened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and you heard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The terms of a shameful bargain&mdash;beauty on the one
side, gold on the other; so many thousand francs a year; a villa
near Naples&mdash;Pah! it makes me sick to repeat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with a shudder, he poured out another glass of wine and
drank it at a draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that,&rdquo; he said, presently, &ldquo;I made no
effort to bring her away.&nbsp; The whole thing was so
cold-blooded, so deliberate, so shameful, that I felt I had only
to wipe her out of my memory, and leave her to her fate.&nbsp; I
stole out of the cathedral, and walked about here by the sea for
ever so long, trying to get my thoughts straight.&nbsp; Then I
remembered you, Ben; and the recollection of how this wanton had
come between us and broken up our lives drove me wild.&nbsp; So I
went up to the station and waited for you.&nbsp; I felt you ought
to know it all; and&mdash;and I thought, perhaps, that we might
go back to England together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Marchese Loredano!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all that I could say; all that I could think.&nbsp; As
Mat had just said of himself, I felt &ldquo;like one
stunned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one other thing I may as well tell you,&rdquo;
he added, reluctantly, &ldquo;if only to show you how false a
woman can be.&nbsp; We&mdash;we were to have been married next
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>&ldquo;<i>We</i>?&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that we were to have been married&mdash;Gianetta
and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden storm of rage, of scorn, of incredulity, swept over
me at this, and seemed to carry my senses away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gianetta marry
you!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had not believed it,&rdquo; he replied,
looking up as if puzzled by my vehemence.&nbsp; &ldquo;But she
promised me; and I thought, when she promised it, she meant
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me, weeks ago, that she would never be your
wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His colour rose, his brow darkened; when his answer came, it
was as calm as the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then it is only
one baseness more.&nbsp; She told me that she had refused you;
and that was why we kept our engagement secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, Mat Price,&rdquo; I said, well-nigh
beside myself with suspicion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confess that every
word of this is false!&nbsp; Confess that Gianetta will not
listen to you, and that you are afraid I may succeed where you
have failed.&nbsp; As perhaps I shall&mdash;as perhaps I shall,
after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I believe it&rsquo;s just a trick to get me <!--
page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>away to England&mdash;that I don&rsquo;t credit a
syllable of your story.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a liar, and I hate
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose, and, laying one hand on the back of his chair, looked
me sternly in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were not Benjamin Hardy,&rdquo; he said,
deliberately, &ldquo;I would thrash you within an inch of your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words had no sooner passed his lips than I sprang at
him.&nbsp; I have never been able distinctly to remember what
followed.&nbsp; A curse&mdash;a blow&mdash;a struggle&mdash;a
moment of blind fury&mdash;a cry&mdash;a confusion of
tongues&mdash;a circle of strange faces.&nbsp; Then I see Mat
lying back in the arms of a bystander; myself trembling and
bewildered&mdash;the knife dropping from my grasp; blood upon the
floor; blood upon my hands; blood upon his shirt.&nbsp; And then
I hear those dreadful words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Ben, you have murdered me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not die&mdash;at least, not there and then.&nbsp; He
was carried to the nearest hospital, and lay for some weeks
between life and death.&nbsp; His case, they said, was difficult
and dangerous.&nbsp; The knife had gone in just below the
collarbone, and pierced down into the lungs.&nbsp; He was not
allowed to speak or turn&mdash;scarcely to breathe with
freedom.&nbsp; He might not even lift his head to drink.&nbsp; I
sat by him day and night all through that sorrowful time.&nbsp; I
gave up my situation on the railway; I quitted my lodging in the
Vicolo Balba; I tried to forget <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>that such a
woman as Gianetta Coneglia had ever drawn breath.&nbsp; I lived
only for Mat; and he tried to live more, I believe, for my sake
than his own.&nbsp; Thus, in the bitter silent hours of pain and
penitence, when no hand but mine approached his lips or smoothed
his pillow, the old friendship came back with even more than its
old trust and faithfulness.&nbsp; He forgave me, fully and
freely; and I would thankfully have given my life for him.</p>
<p>At length there came one bright spring morning, when,
dismissed as convalescent, he tottered out through the hospital
gates, leaning on my arm, and feeble as an infant.&nbsp; He was
not cured; neither, as I then learned to my horror and anguish,
was it possible that he ever could be cured.&nbsp; He might live,
with care, for some years; but the lungs were injured beyond hope
of remedy, and a strong or healthy man he could never be
again.&nbsp; These, spoken aside to me, were the parting words of
the chief physician, who advised me to take him further south
without delay.</p>
<p>I took him to a little coast-town called Rocca, some thirty
miles beyond Genoa&mdash;a sheltered lonely place along the
Riviera, where the sea was even bluer than the sky, and the
cliffs were green with strange tropical plants, cacti, and aloes,
and Egyptian palms.&nbsp; Here we lodged in the house of a small
tradesman; and Mat, to use his own words, &ldquo;set to work <!--
page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>at getting well in good earnest.&rdquo;&nbsp; But,
alas! it was a work which no earnestness could forward.&nbsp; Day
after day he went down to the beach, and sat for hours drinking
the sea air and watching the sails that came and went in the
offing.&nbsp; By-and-by he could go no further than the garden of
the house in which we lived.&nbsp; A little later, and he spent
his days on a couch beside the open window, waiting patiently for
the end.&nbsp; Ay, for the end!&nbsp; It had come to that.&nbsp;
He was fading fast, waning with the waning summer, and conscious
that the Reaper was at hand.&nbsp; His whole aim now was to
soften the agony of my remorse, and prepare me for what must
shortly come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not live longer, if I could,&rdquo; he said,
lying on his couch one summer evening, and looking up to the
stars.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had my choice at this moment, I would
ask to go.&nbsp; I should like Gianetta to know that I forgave
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall know it,&rdquo; I said, trembling suddenly
from head to foot.</p>
<p>He pressed my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll write to father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had drawn a little back, that he might not see the tears
raining down my cheeks; but he raised himself on his elbow, and
looked round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, Ben,&rdquo; he whispered; laid his
<!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>head back wearily upon the pillow&mdash;and so
died.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And this was the end of it.&nbsp; This was the end of all that
made life life to me.&nbsp; I buried him there, in hearing of the
wash of a strange sea on a strange shore.&nbsp; I stayed by the
grave till the priest and the bystanders were gone.&nbsp; I saw
the earth filled in to the last sod, and the gravedigger stamp it
down with his feet.&nbsp; Then, and not till then, I felt that I
had lost him for ever&mdash;the friend I had loved, and hated,
and slain.&nbsp; Then, and not till then, I knew that all rest,
and joy, and hope were over for me.&nbsp; From that moment my
heart hardened within me, and my life was filled with
loathing.&nbsp; Day and night, land and sea, labour and rest,
food and sleep, were alike hateful to me.&nbsp; It was the curse
of Cain, and that my brother had pardoned me made it lie none the
lighter.&nbsp; Peace on earth was for me no more, and goodwill
towards men was dead in my heart for ever.&nbsp; Remorse softens
some natures; but it poisoned mine.&nbsp; I hated all mankind;
but above all mankind I hated the woman who had come between us
two, and ruined both our lives.</p>
<p>He had bidden me seek her out, and be the messenger of his
forgiveness.&nbsp; I had sooner have gone down to the port of
Genoa and taken upon me the serge cap and shotted chain <!-- page
207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>of
any galley-slave at his toil in the public works; but for all
that I did my best to obey him.&nbsp; I went back, alone and on
foot.&nbsp; I went back, intending to say to her, &ldquo;Gianetta
Coneglia, he forgave you; but God never will.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
she was gone.&nbsp; The little shop was let to a fresh occupant;
and the neighbours only knew that mother and daughter had left
the place quite suddenly, and that Gianetta was supposed to be
under the &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of the Marchese
Loredano.&nbsp; How I made inquiries here and there&mdash;how I
heard that they had gone to Naples&mdash;and how, being restless
and reckless of my time, I worked my passage in a French steamer,
and followed her&mdash;how, having found the sumptuous villa that
was now hers, I learned that she had left there some ten days and
gone to Paris, where the Marchese was ambassador for the Two
Sicilies&mdash;how, working my passage back again to Marseilles,
and thence, in part by the river and in part by the rail, I made
my way to Paris&mdash;how, day after day, I paced the streets and
the parks, watched at the ambassador&rsquo;s gates, followed his
carriage, and at last, after weeks of waiting, discovered her
address&mdash;how, having written to request an interview, her
servants spurned me from her door and flung my letter in my
face&mdash;how, looking up at her windows, I then, instead of
forgiving, solemnly cursed her with the bitterest curses <!--
page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>my tongue could devise&mdash;and how, this done, I
shook the dust of Paris from my feet, and became a wanderer upon
the face of the earth, are facts which I have now no space to
tell.</p>
<p>The next six or eight years of my life were shifting and
unsettled enough.&nbsp; A morose and restless man, I took
employment here and there, as opportunity offered, turning my
hand to many things, and caring little what I earned, so long as
the work was hard and the change incessant.&nbsp; First of all I
engaged myself as chief engineer in one of the French steamers
plying between Marseilles and Constantinople.&nbsp; At
Constantinople I changed to one of the Austrian Lloyd&rsquo;s
boats, and worked for some time to and from Alexandria, Jaffa,
and those parts.&nbsp; After that, I fell in with a party of Mr.
Layard&rsquo;s men at Cairo, and so went up the Nile and took a
turn at the excavations of the mound of Nimroud.&nbsp; Then I
became a working engineer on the new desert line between
Alexandria and Suez; and by-and-by I worked my passage out to
Bombay, and took service as an engine fitter on one of the great
Indian railways.&nbsp; I stayed a long time in India; that is to
say, I stayed nearly two years, which was a long time for me; and
I might not even have left so soon, but for the war that was
declared just then with Russia.&nbsp; That tempted me.&nbsp; For
I loved danger and hardship as other men love safety and ease;
<!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>and as for my life, I had sooner have parted from it
than kept it, any day.&nbsp; So I came straight back to England;
betook myself to Portsmouth, where my testimonials at once
procured me the sort of berth I wanted.&nbsp; I went out to the
Crimea in the engine-room of one of her Majesty&rsquo;s war
steamers.</p>
<p>I served with the fleet, of course, while the war lasted; and
when it was over, went wandering off again, rejoicing in my
liberty.&nbsp; This time I went to Canada, and after working on a
railway then in progress near the American frontier, I presently
passed over into the States; journeyed from north to south;
crossed the Rocky Mountains; tried a month or two of life in the
gold country; and then, being seized with a sudden, aching,
unaccountable longing to revisit that solitary grave so far away
on the Italian coast, I turned my face once more towards
Europe.</p>
<p>Poor little grave!&nbsp; I found it rank with weeds, the cross
half shattered, the inscription half effaced.&nbsp; It was as if
no one had loved him, or remembered him.&nbsp; I went back to the
house in which we had lodged together.&nbsp; The same people were
still living there, and made me kindly welcome.&nbsp; I stayed
with them for some weeks.&nbsp; I weeded, and planted, and
trimmed the grave with my own hands, and set up a fresh cross in
pure white marble.&nbsp; It was the first season of rest that I
had known <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>since I laid him there; and when at
last I shouldered my knapsack and set forth again to battle with
the world, I promised myself that, God willing, I would creep
back to Rocca, when my days drew near to ending, and be buried by
his side.</p>
<p>From hence, being, perhaps, a little less inclined than
formerly for very distant parts, and willing to keep within reach
of that grave, I went no further than Mantua, where I engaged
myself as an engine-driver on the line, then not long completed,
between that city and Venice.&nbsp; Somehow, although I had been
trained to the working engineering, I preferred in these days to
earn my bread by driving.&nbsp; I liked the excitement of it, the
sense of power, the rush of the air, the roar of the fire, the
flitting of the landscape.&nbsp; Above all, I enjoyed to drive a
night express.&nbsp; The worse the weather, the better it suited
with my sullen temper.&nbsp; For I was as hard, and harder than
ever.&nbsp; The years had done nothing to soften me.&nbsp; They
had only confirmed all that was blackest and bitterest in my
heart.</p>
<p>I continued pretty faithful to the Mantua line, and had been
working on it steadily for more than seven months when that which
I am now about to relate took place.</p>
<p>It was in the month of March.&nbsp; The weather had been
unsettled for some days past, and the nights stormy; and at one
point along the <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>line, near Ponte di Brenta, the
waters had risen and swept away some seventy yards of
embankment.&nbsp; Since this accident, the trains had all been
obliged to stop at a certain spot between Padua and Ponte di
Brenta, and the passengers, with their luggage, had thence to be
transported in all kinds of vehicles, by a circuitous country
road, to the nearest station on the other side of the gap, where
another train and engine awaited them.&nbsp; This, of course,
caused great confusion and annoyance, put all our time-tables
wrong, and subjected the public to a large amount of
inconvenience.&nbsp; In the meanwhile an army of navvies was
drafted to the spot, and worked day and night to repair the
damage.&nbsp; At this time I was driving two through trains each
day; namely, one from Mantua to Venice in the early morning, and
a return train from Venice to Mantua in the afternoon&mdash;a
tolerably full day&rsquo;s work, covering about one hundred and
ninety miles of ground, and occupying between ten and eleven
hours.&nbsp; I was therefore not best pleased when, on the third
or fourth day after the accident, I was informed that, in
addition to my regular allowance of work, I should that evening
be required to drive a special train to Venice.&nbsp; This
special train, consisting of an engine, a single carriage, and a
break-van, was to leave the Mantua platform at eleven; at Padua
the passengers were to alight and find post-chaises waiting to
convey them to Ponte <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>di Brenta; at Ponte di Brenta
another engine, carriage, and break-van were to be in
readiness.&nbsp; I was charged to accompany them throughout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corpo di Bacco,&rdquo; said the clerk who gave me my
orders, &ldquo;you need not look so black, man.&nbsp; You are
certain of a handsome gratuity.&nbsp; Do you know who goes with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you, indeed!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s the Duca
Loredano, the Neapolitan ambassador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loredano!&rdquo; I stammered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
Loredano?&nbsp; There was a Marchese&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certo.&nbsp; He was the Marchese Loredano some years
ago; but he has come into his dukedom since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be a very old man by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is old; but what of that?&nbsp; He is as hale,
and bright, and stately as ever.&nbsp; You have seen him
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, turning away; &ldquo;I have seen
him&mdash;years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of his marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>The clerk chuckled, rubbed his hands, and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An extraordinary affair,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Made a tremendous esclandre at the time.&nbsp; He married
his mistress&mdash;quite a common, vulgar girl&mdash;a
Genoese&mdash;very handsome; but not received, of course.&nbsp;
Nobody visits her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>&ldquo;Married her!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my hand to my head.&nbsp; I felt as if I had had a fall
or a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she&mdash;does she go to-night?&rdquo; I
faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, yes&mdash;goes everywhere with him&mdash;never
lets him out of her sight.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see her&mdash;la
bella Duchessa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this my informant laughed, and rubbed his hands again,
and went back to his office.</p>
<p>The day went by, I scarcely know how, except that my whole
soul was in a tumult of rage and bitterness.&nbsp; I returned
from my afternoon&rsquo;s work about 7.25, and at 10.30 I was
once again at the station.&nbsp; I had examined the engine; given
instructions to the Fochista, or stoker, about the fire; seen to
the supply of oil; and got all in readiness, when, just as I was
about to compare my watch with the clock in the ticket-office, a
hand was laid upon my arm, and a voice in my ear said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the engine-driver who is going on with this
special train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never seen the speaker before.&nbsp; He was a small,
dark man, muffled up about the throat, with blue glasses, a large
black beard, and his hat drawn low upon his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a poor man, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, in a
quick, eager whisper, &ldquo;and, like other poor men, would not
object to be better off.&nbsp; <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Would you
like to earn a couple of thousand florins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; You are to stop at Padua, are you not, and
to go on again at Ponte di Brenta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you did nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Suppose,
instead of turning off the steam, you jump off the engine, and
let the train run on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible.&nbsp; There are seventy yards of embankment
gone, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basta!&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; Save yourself, and let
the train run on.&nbsp; It would be nothing but an
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned hot and cold; I trembled; my heart beat fast, and my
breath failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you tempt me?&rdquo; I faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Italy&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;for
liberty&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; I know you are no Italian; but, for
all that, you may be a friend.&nbsp; This Loredano is one of his
country&rsquo;s bitterest enemies.&nbsp; Stay, here are the two
thousand florins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thrust his hand back fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
blood-money.&nbsp; If I do it, I do it neither for Italy nor for
money; but for vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For vengeance!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>At this moment the signal was given for backing up to the
platform.&nbsp; I sprang to my place upon the engine without
another word.&nbsp; <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>When I again looked towards the spot
where he had been standing, the stranger was gone.</p>
<p>I saw them take their places&mdash;Duke and Duchess, secretary
and priest, valet and maid.&nbsp; I saw the station-master bow
them into the carriage, and stand, bareheaded, beside the
door.&nbsp; I could not distinguish their faces; the platform was
too dusk, and the glare from the engine fire too strong; but I
recognised her stately figure, and the poise of her head.&nbsp;
Had I not been told who she was, I should have known her by those
traits alone.&nbsp; Then the guard&rsquo;s whistle shrilled out,
and the station-master made his last bow; I turned the steam on;
and we started.</p>
<p>My blood was on fire.&nbsp; I no longer trembled or
hesitated.&nbsp; I felt as if every nerve was iron, and every
pulse instinct with deadly purpose.&nbsp; She was in my power,
and I would be revenged.&nbsp; She should die&mdash;she, for whom
I had stained my soul with my friend&rsquo;s blood!&nbsp; She
should die, in the plenitude of her wealth and her beauty, and no
power upon earth should save her!</p>
<p>The stations flew past.&nbsp; I put on more steam; I bade the
fireman heap in the coke, and stir the blazing mass.&nbsp; I
would have outstripped the wind, had it been possible.&nbsp;
Faster and faster&mdash;hedges and trees, bridges and stations,
flashing past&mdash;villages no sooner seen than
gone&mdash;telegraph wires twisting, and <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>dipping,
and twining themselves in one, with the awful swiftness of our
pace!&nbsp; Faster and faster, till the fireman at my side looks
white and scared, and refuses to add more fuel to the
furnace.&nbsp; Faster and faster, till the wind rushes in our
faces and drives the breath back upon our lips.</p>
<p>I would have scorned to save myself.&nbsp; I meant to die with
the rest.&nbsp; Mad as I was&mdash;and I believe from my very
soul that I was utterly mad for the time&mdash;I felt a passing
pang of pity for the old man and his suite.&nbsp; I would have
spared the poor fellow at my side, too, if I could; but the pace
at which we were going made escape impossible.</p>
<p>Vicenza was passed&mdash;a mere confused vision of
lights.&nbsp; Pojana flew by.&nbsp; At Padua, but nine miles
distant, our passengers were to alight.&nbsp; I saw the
fireman&rsquo;s face turned upon me in remonstrance; I saw his
lips move, though I could not hear a word; I saw his expression
change suddenly from remonstrance to a deadly terror, and
then&mdash;merciful Heaven! then, for the first time, I saw that
he and I were no longer alone upon the engine.</p>
<p>There was a third man&mdash;a third man standing on my right
hand, as the fireman was standing on my left&mdash;a tall,
stalwart man, with short curling hair, and a flat Scotch cap upon
his head.&nbsp; As I fell back in the first shock of surprise, he
stepped nearer; took my place at <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>the engine,
and turned the steam off.&nbsp; I opened my lips to speak to him;
he turned his head slowly, and looked me in the face.</p>
<p>Matthew Price!</p>
<p>I uttered one long wild cry, flung my arms wildly up above my
head, and fell as if I had been smitten with an axe.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am prepared for the objections that may be made to my
story.&nbsp; I expect, as a matter of course, to be told that
this was an optical illusion, or that I was suffering from
pressure on the brain, or even that I laboured under an attack of
temporary insanity.&nbsp; I have heard all these arguments
before, and, if I may be forgiven for saying so, I have no desire
to hear them again.&nbsp; My own mind has been made up upon this

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
