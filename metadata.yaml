description: Arriving at Mugby Junction in an attempt to escape his unhappy past,
  Barbox Brothers befriends a workman and his invalid daughter. With their help, he
  sets his sights on discovering which of the seven lines of the junction will most
  aid him in his journey of escape. In exploring one such line, he meets "the woman
  he had lost," only to return to Mugby Junction once this has played out. Staying
  there, and continuing his friendship with the workman and his daughter, he collects
  the myriad stories he hears tell of at the junction.
